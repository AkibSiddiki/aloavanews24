		<description><p>audi Arabia&rsquo;s monarch, King Salman bin Abdulaziz, has been at odds with his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, over embracing the Jewish state. The king is a longtime supporter of the Arab boycott of Israel and the Palestinians&rsquo; demand for an independent state. The prince wants to move past what he sees as an intractable conflict to join with Israel in business and align against Iran.</p>

<p>When President Trump announced on Aug. 13 that Israel and the U.A.E. were normalizing diplomatic ties, the deal stunned the 84-year-old king, who had just begun his summer holiday, according to people familiar with the matter, including Saudi advisers. His son wasn&rsquo;t so surprised.</p>

<p>Prince Mohammed feared his father might block a deal that didn&rsquo;t do enough to advance the cause of Palestinian statehood, those people said. If the king of Saudi Arabia, the biggest economy in the Middle East and the guardian of Islam&rsquo;s holiest sites, didn&rsquo;t support it, the neighboring Emiratis would be hard-pressed to move ahead. Prince Mohammed didn&rsquo;t tell his father about the planned accord, which didn&rsquo;t mention Palestinian statehood. Israel agreed only to suspend plans to annex parts of Israeli-occupied territory in the West Bank in return for diplomatic recognition from the U.A.E.</p>

<p>A furious King Salman later ordered his foreign minister to restate the kingdom&rsquo;s commitment to the establishment of a Palestinian state, without mentioning the normalization deal. A royal family member close to him wrote an op-ed in a Saudi-owned newspaper reiterating that position and implying the Emiratis should have pressed the Israelis for more concessions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If any Arab state will follow the United Arab Emirates,&rdquo; wrote Prince Turki al-Faisal, the former Saudi ambassador to the U.S., &ldquo;it should demand in return a price, and it should be a high price.&rdquo; The Saudi media ministry didn&rsquo;t respond to a request to comment for this article.</p>

<p>Normalizing relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel before any deal for Palestinian statehood would be a seismic shift in the Middle East, upending a decades-old pan-Arab position. Tensions atop the Saudi ruling family suggest the kingdom&rsquo;s position on the tumultuous region&rsquo;s central conflict could change sooner than expected, but that such a shift would entail more turbulence.</p>

<p>The Trump administration has pressed to bring together Saudi Arabia and Israel, its top regional allies and Iran&rsquo;s main rivals. Such an arrangement would allow for greater intelligence sharing and ease Israel&rsquo;s isolation as Washington reduces its military presence in parts of the Middle East.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Israel has to wait it out,&rdquo; said Yoel Guzansky, a former director of Iran and Gulf desk on Israel&rsquo;s national security council. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more a matter of when and not if. When and at what price, and the price [demanded by the Saudis] is being negotiated with the White House, not with Israel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Time is on Israel&rsquo;s side. Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s overwhelmingly young population feels less connected to the plight of the Palestinians than their parents and grandparents did, said David Rundell, a retired senior U.S. diplomat who worked in Saudi Arabia. Those &ldquo;who grew up with two Arab-Israeli wars and the Palestinian cause beat into them since they were children are angry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They feel the Emiratis have betrayed the Palestinians. Most Saudis under 30 don&rsquo;t really care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia and Israel have maintained discreet but frequent informal contacts on security issues, mostly related to Iran, for around 30 years. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has had to walk a fine line to pursue its twin goals of maintaining its alliance with the U.S., especially in confronting Iran, and continuing its longstanding support for Palestinians. That sometimes has led Saudi officials to voice one position in private and another in public, or even to take divergent public positions.</p>

<p>King Salman, a son of the modern Saudi state&rsquo;s founder, lived through Israeli conquests of Arab territory, which instilled in him a devotion to the Palestinian cause, according to Saudi analysts and U.S. officials. When serving as governor of the Saudi capital before ascending the throne, he often referred to himself as &ldquo;Palestine&rsquo;s ambassador in Riyadh,&rdquo; according to the actual Palestinian ambassador, Bassem Al Agha .</p>

<p>In 1973, flush with petrodollars, Saudi Arabia imposed an oil embargo on the U.S., one of its closest allies, for supporting Israel in war against Egypt and Syria. It later forged a pan-Arab position that normal relations with Israel would come only with an independent Palestinian state.</p>

<p>Until the U.A.E. and Bahrain broke ranks this summer, that remained the stance of all Arab states, although Egypt and Jordan had already signed peace treaties with Israel.</p>

<p>For decades, King Salman has funneled billions of dollars to the Palestinians and developed personal relationships with most of their leaders.</p>

<p>When President Trump was entering office in 2017, King Salman sent him a message saying he believed in Israel&rsquo;s right to exist but also in the Palestinians&rsquo; right to have their own state, said departing U.S. Ambassador Joseph Westphal, who relayed it to the president&rsquo;s transition team. That May, during President Trump&rsquo;s first trip abroad, Saudi Arabia allowed him to fly from Riyadh to Tel Aviv, a rare link between the two countries that underlined the aging monarch&rsquo;s hope that the new U.S. administration would work toward his long-held goal of Palestinian statehood. He was soon disappointed.</p>

<p>When Jared Kushner, the president&rsquo;s son-in-law and senior adviser, arrived in the region to sell President Trump&rsquo;s Middle East peace plan to the Saudis, he promoted an early version that denied the Palestinians a capital in urban East Jerusalem and aligned with an Israeli push to grant the Palestinians limited self-government in patches of the West Bank, with no right of return for refugees displaced by earlier wars.</p>

<p>In a phone call with President Trump on Sept. 6, King Salman reiterated his desire for a solution to the Palestinian issue and referenced a 2002 Saudi-backed initiative promising normal relations with Israel only once that happens, according to a summary of the conversation from the Saudi state news agency.</p>

<p>By contrast, since assuming the day-to-day responsibility of the Saudi government in 2017, the 35-year-old prince has expressed unusual openness toward Israel and accelerated engagements on security and commerce.</p>

<p>Soon after Prince Mohammed became heir apparent by replacing an older cousin in a late-night palace coup, he was privately pressuring Palestinian leaders to accept an early version of Mr. Trump&rsquo;s peace plan, Arab officials familiar with the discussions have said. The Palestinians refused, saying it endangered their aspirations for statehood.</p>

<p>In October 2017, the prince unveiled plans to build Neom, a $500 billion futuristic city-state across adjacent parts of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Egypt&mdash;territory that abuts Israel. Prince Mohammed had suggested privately, according to his advisers and foreign diplomats, that he hoped the Israelis would play a big part in developing Neom, with potential investments in biotechnology and cybersecurity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He sees it as what&rsquo;s practical and needed,&rdquo; said Mr. Westphal, the U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 2014 to 2017, of the prince&rsquo;s outreach to Israel. He said the king, who underwent gallbladder surgery in July and has been ailing for several years, &ldquo;is not necessarily witting to everything that&rsquo;s going on and involved to the extent that one would need to be involved to be in control of all these things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prince Mohammed needs to maintain support from the Trump administration. The crown prince has faced international furor over the 2018 killing of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi operatives. He denies ordering the murder but said he bears ultimate responsibility as the country&rsquo;s de facto leader. The Saudi crown prince hasn&rsquo;t visited the U.S. or Europe since Mr. Khashoggi&rsquo;s murder.</p>

<p>With the Trump administration eager to recruit more Arab allies to replicate the U.A.E.-Israel agreement before the November elections, Mr. Kushner flew to Saudi Arabia to press the royal father-son duo. At a palace meeting on Sept. 1 in Neom, Prince Mohammed said the king wouldn&rsquo;t accept the envoy&rsquo;s proposal for a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel, according to people familiar with the discussion.</p>

<p>In light of his father&rsquo;s resistance, Prince Mohammed told Mr. Kushner that the most the kingdom could do for now was to get tiny Bahrain to participate in a deal, those people said.</p>

<p>Asked if Saudi Arabia had given Bahrain approval to normalize ties with Israel, a spokesperson for the Bahrain government said it &ldquo;remains committed to working with all of its strategic partners to achieve a just and enduring peace within the region.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A senior Trump administration official said Prince Mohammed presented Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s position about relations with Israel. In the meeting, the prince agreed to open Saudi airspace to flights to and from Israel and told Mr. Kushner that if Bahrain decides to normalize ties with Israel, &ldquo;there was a clear pathway to do that,&rdquo; the senior official said.</p>

<p>Bahrain&rsquo;s leadership pushed ahead with joining the U.A.E. diplomatic deal. At the White House on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the foreign ministers of the U.A.E. and Bahrain joined President Trump for a signing ceremony that the president called the foundation of a broader alignment against Iran. No Saudi representative attended.</p>

<p>Under the so-called Abraham Accords, the former adversaries will establish embassies in one another&rsquo;s countries and begin to cooperate economically, politically and socially. The Emiratis also reached a separate understanding that the U.S. would look favorably upon its requests for advanced F-35 stealth fighters.</p>

<p>It won&rsquo;t be easy for Saudi Arabia to erase one major obstacle to ties with Israel. Generations of Saudis have been conditioned to hate Jews. School textbooks called them swines and apes; mosque preachers have prayed for victory over the &ldquo;invader and aggressor&rdquo; Jews; and the news media has referred to Israel as &ldquo;the Zionist enemy.&rdquo;</p></description>

				<p>Bangladesh Jewellers Samity (BJS) has set new price of gold, decreasing by Tk 2,449 to Tk 74,008 a bhori (11.66 grams) in the local market.</p>

<p>The BJS in a press release on Thursday (Sept 24) announced the decreased price with effect from today.
&nbsp;

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">The court has sentenced six of the 10 adult accused, including Rifat&rsquo;s wife Ayesha Siddika Minni, to death in the widely discussed Rifat Sharif murder case in Barguna. The other four have been acquitted.</p>

<p>Barguna District and Sessions Judge Ashaduzzaman announced the verdict on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Rifat Sharif was hacked to death by a gang of teenagers in front of Barguna Government College on the morning of June 26 last year. The killings shook the whole country.</p>

<p>Kishore Gang &lsquo;Bond Group&rsquo; publicly hacked Shahnewaz Rifat (Rifat Sharif). He then died at Barisal Sher-e-Bangla Medical College Hospital that afternoon while undergoing treatment.</p>

<p>The day after the incident on June 27 Rifat&#39;s father Md. Abdul Halim Dulal Sharif filed a murder case against 5-6 more unidentified persons mentioning the names of 12 persons. After that, the police arrested the accused one by one.</p>

<p>Sabbir Ahmed Nayan alias Nayan Bond, the main accused in the case, was killed in a gunfight with police on the morning of July 2, six days after the incident.</p>

<p>Two months and six days after Rifat&#39;s murder, on the afternoon of September 1 last year, the Barguna Senior Judicial Magistrate&#39;s Court indicted 24 people and filed two investigation reports, dividing them into adults and minors. Of these, 10 are adult offenders and 14 are juveniles.</p>

<p>The District and Sessions Judge of Barguna constituted the charge on January 1, 2020 to start the judicial proceedings of the adult accused. However, Musa Bond, one of the accused in the case, is still absconding.</p>

<p>The court started taking testimony against 10 adult accused from January 8 and completed the testimony of 76 witness in the case on February 25.</p>

<p>The court fixed September 30 for announcing the verdict of the 10 adult convicted after the arguments of both of the parties.</p></description>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">The verdict on the Babri Masjid demolition case has been announced after 28 years. Judge Surendra Kumar Yadav delivered the verdict in a special court in Lucknow just before his retirement on Wednesday. The court acquitted all the 32 accused. The judge argued that the devastation was not premeditated. The court also said that the evidence was not enough. As a result, all the accused were released with dignity.</p>

<p>The verdict on the destruction of Babri is about 2000 pages. The work of writing the verdict started on September 2. Judge Surendra Kumar Yadav started reading the verdict at 11.50 am on Wednesday. Judge Surendra Kumar Yadav reached the court around 10.30 am. Reaching one by one, Sadhvi Ritambhara, Sakshi Maharajas. A total of 26 accused joined the court. However, Lal Krishna Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi could not come due to old age. They joined the video conference. Uma Bharati could not come due to coronavirus attack. Mahant Nritya Gopal Das also did not come. No one except the accused, CBI lawyers and defendants&rsquo; lawyers had access to the court premises.</p>

<p>It was December 6, 1992. The whole country saw the frantic violence. The century-old Babri Masjid was destroyed by the attack of Ram devotees. The community violence claimed at least 1,800. A special CBI court in Lucknow on Wednesday announced the verdict in a case of demolition of a mosque after 28 years. Of the total 49 accused in the case, 17 died.</p>

<p>The Ayodhya land case has already been settled last year. On November 9, a five-judge bench rejected the Sunni Waqf Board&#39;s demand and ordered the construction of a Ram temple there. However, the Supreme Court also condemned the demolition of Babri Masjid.</p></description>

				<h2 style="text-align:justify">Kids&#39; favorite television show Sisimpur is going to on air on Bangladesh Television seven days a week from Thursday (October 1). This popular children&#39;s program will be aired on Friday and Saturday at 10:10 am and every day from Sunday to Thursday at 5:10 pm.</p>

<p>There will be new episodes every day. Previously only one episode was shown four days a week. Sisimpur has been broadcasting on BTV since its inception 15 years ago. All the children of the country will get the opportunity to watch Sisimpur through BTV.</p>

<p>In this regard, Sisimpur Executive Director Mohammad Shah Alam said, Sisimpur is a unique initiative in the education and development of pre-primary level children - each part of which is researched and built keeping in mind the psychological aspects of children. This initiative has been taken so that all the children of the country including the children of remote areas get the opportunity to visit Sisimpur every day. The joint decision of the Ministry of Women and Children&#39;s Affairs, Bangladesh Television and Sisimpur-based Sisimpur Workshop is going to take effect from Thursday, October 1.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He further said, &quot;We always want this effort of Sisimpur to reach all the children of Bangladesh.&quot; It is possible to reach the largest number of people through BTV.

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden called Republican incumbent Donald Trump a &ldquo;clown&rdquo; on Tuesday as tension boiled over in the pair&rsquo;s first televised debate ahead of the November election.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to get any word in with this clown &mdash; excuse me, this person,&rdquo; said Biden, moments after Trump was warned by moderator Chris Wallace not to interrupt.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden battled fiercely over Trump&rsquo;s record on the coronavirus pandemic, healthcare, and the economy in a chaotic and bad-tempered first debate marked by personal insults and Trump&rsquo;s repeated interruptions.</p>

<p>Trump bulldozed his way through the 90-minute debate, trying to goad Biden, claiming that Democrats were trying to steal the November presidential election and declining to condemn white supremacist groups when asked to do so.</p>

<p>Moderator Chris Wallace never established control of the debate, with Trump repeatedly ignoring his calls to let Biden speak. The two White House contenders talked over each other and lobbed insults in a breathtaking political brawl that made it hard for either to make a point.</p>

<p>At one point, an exasperated Biden said after Trump&rsquo;s repeated interruptions: &ldquo;Will you shut up, man? This is so unpresidential.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wallace tried in vain to reel in Trump, who ignored his time limits and talked over Biden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that the country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I&rsquo;m appealing to you, sir, to do that,&rdquo; Wallace said.</p>

<p>When Trump said he should tell Biden the same thing, Wallace said: &ldquo;Well, frankly, you&rsquo;ve been doing more interrupting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As of Tuesday evening, 1.4 million Americans already had cast early ballots. With time running out to change minds or influence the small sliver of undecided voters, the stakes were enormous as the two White House candidates took the stage five weeks before the Nov. 3 Election Day.</p>

<p>For Trump, 74, Tuesday&rsquo;s debate represented one of the few remaining chances to change the trajectory of a race that most opinion polls show him losing, as the majority of Americans disapprove of his handling of both the coronavirus pandemic and protests over racial injustice.</p>

<p>Biden, 77, has held a consistent lead over Trump in national opinion polls, although surveys in the battleground states that will decide the election show a closer contest. It was hard to determine whether the debate would move the needle.</p>

<p>Trump, asked if he was willing to condemn white supremacists and tell them to stand down, initially said he would be willing to do anything for peace but then said most of the violence was from the left-wing.</p>

<p>Trump, asked if he was willing to condemn white supremacists and tell them to stand down, initially said he would be willing to do anything for peace but then said most of the violence was from the left-wing.</p>

<p>He also repeated his unfounded complaints that mail-in ballots would lead to widespread fraud in the election and declined to commit to accepting the results of the election or commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the election.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can&rsquo;t go along with that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is going to be a fraud like you&rsquo;ve never seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Biden urged Americans to make a plan to vote and assured voters that Trump would be gone if Biden won. He said he would not declare victory until the outcome was validated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we get the votes, it&rsquo;s going to be all over. He&rsquo;s going to go,&rdquo; he said, adding Trump&rsquo;s complaints about mail-in ballots was that Trump was &ldquo;afraid&rdquo; to count the votes.</p>

<p>Biden also brought up a recent report that Trump had called members of the military &ldquo;losers&rdquo; and &ldquo;suckers.&rdquo; Biden, whose son Beau died of cancer, had served in the military.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was not a loser, and he was a patriot,&rdquo; Biden said.</p>

<p>The two contenders did not shake hands as they entered the debate, adhering to protocols on social distancing because of the coronavirus.</p></description>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">The High Court on Wednesday set a date for the verdict in the compensation case filed by Jahalam, who was in jail for three and a half years as wrong accused in 26 cases of Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC). The verdict is due at two o&#39;clock this noon.</p>

<p>A virtual high court bench comprising Justice FRM Nazmul Ahsan and Justice KM Kamrul Quader fixed the date and time on Tuesday.</p>

<p>In addition, the same bench has set a date of Thursday for the verdict on the writ petition in the case of Russell Sarkar, who lost his leg due to the willful ramming of Greenline bus.</p>

<p>In January last year, the High Court issued a self-imposed rule on the release and compensation of Jahlam, who had been lodged in jail for three years in a case filed by the ACC on charges of forgery of Tk 18 crore loan of Sonali Bank. Jahalam was released from jail on February 3 last year on a court order. The bench heard the rule on February 12 this year and the matter is awaiting verdict.</p>

<p>Supreme Court lawyer Umme Kulsum has filed a writ petition seeking compensation of crores of takas for the loss of Russell Sarkar&#39;s leg in a bus crash in 2018. The same bench of the High Court ruled on May 14 of that year. Rule asked why instruction would not be made to pay crores of takas compensation for Russell.</p></description>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">Delhi Capitals couldn&rsquo;t bag a hat-trick win in the ongoing UAE IPL. On the other hand, David Warner&#39;s Sunrisers Hyderabad saw their first win in the IPL defeating Delhi by 15 runs.</p>

<p>After batting with a target of 163 runs, Delhi lost to Prithvi Swah and fell under pressure. Then Shikhar Dhawan and Shreyas Iyer added 40 runs. Shreyas went to the pavilion after bagging 18 runs only. Shikhar Dhawan scored 34 runs. Both are victims of Rashid Khan. Bhubaneswar Kumar returned Hetmeyer for 21 runs. Rashid Khan returned Rishabh Panth to the dressing room for 32 runs. And that&#39;s when Hyderabad started smelling of victory. Natarajan returned Stoinis. In the end, Delhi lost 7 wickets in 20 overs and made 147 runs. Bhubaneswar Kumar took 2 wickets and Rashid Khan took 3 wickets for Hyderabad.</p>

<p>Earlier, Delhi Capitals captain Shreyas Iyer sent Hyderabad to bat first after winning the toss. Two Hyderabad openers Jonny Bairstow and David Warner got off to a good start. Warner scored 45 runs. Manish went back for just 3 runs. Bairstow scored 53 runs. Ken Williamson made 41 off 26 balls in the first match of the IPL. In the end, Sunrisers Hyderabad lost 4 wickets in 20 overs and scored 162 runs. Amit Mishra and Kagiso Rabada took 2 wickets each.</p></description>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">The court will announce the verdict today (Wednesday) against 10 adults accused in the widely-discussed Rifat Sharif murder case in Barguna. After presenting arguments for and against the accused, Barguna District and Sessions Judge Md. Ashaduzzaman set the date for the verdict.</p>

<p>Testimony and arguments against 14 other juvenile accused in the case have also been completed. The testimony and argument ended in the Barguna Women and Children Court on Tuesday.</p>

<p>According to court sources, the testimony of 76 witnesses has been taken against 10 adults accused in the Rifat murder case. Concerned lawyers presented arguments in the court for and against all the accused. The court set the date for the verdict after presenting arguments for and against Ayesha Siddique Minni, wife of the slain Rifat Sharif, accused No. 7 from witness No. 1.</p>

<p>The adult accused in the chargesheet Md. Musa is still absconding. The rest of the accused are- Rakibul Hasan Rifat Faraji, Al Qayyum alias Rabbi Akon, Mohaiminul Islam Sifat, Rezwan Ali Khan Hriday alias Tiktak Hriday, Md. Hasan, Rafiul Islam Rabbi, Md. Sagar and Kamrul Islam Simon. Minni is on bailout of these 10 accused. All but the fugitive Musa are in jail.</p>

<p>Police are keeping a close watch on various important places in Barguna around the verdict. Police security posts have been set up at various important corners of the district. Apart from RAB members, detectives were also seen patrolling.</p></description>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">Crown Prince Sheikh Nawaf Al Ahmed will be sworn in as the new Emir of Kuwait today. Anas al-Saleh, the country&#39;s deputy prime minister and state minister for cabinet affairs, confirmed the information at a press conference after a parliamentary session on September 30.</p>

<p>The Kuwaiti government has declared 40 days of national mourning over the death of the emir. Besides, all office court activities have been declared closed for 3 days; news state newspaper the Arab Times.</p>

<p>Kuwait&#39;s Emir Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah died on Tuesday in a U.S. hospital. He was 91 years old.</p>

<p>Since 2007, Sheikh Sabah has been the emir of Kuwait, an oil-rich country in the Arabian Gulf. He was suffering from various physical complications for a long time.</p>

<p>Emir Sheikh Sabah was suffering from various physical complications for a long time. His appendix was removed in 2002. Two years later a pacemaker was replaced in his heart. Urinary tract surgery was performed in a US hospital in 2006.</p>

<p>Born in 1929, Sheikh Sabah is widely regarded as the architect of modern Kuwait&rsquo;s foreign policy &ndash; having served as foreign minister for nearly 40 years between 1963 and 2003 &ndash; when he became prime minister.</p>

<p>A longtime widower, Sheikh Sabah lived for years in a palace known as Dar Salwa, which was named after his daughter Salwa, who died of cancer in 2002. He is survived by two sons.</p>

<p>In August 2019, Kuwait acknowledged Sheikh Sabah suffered an unspecified medical &ldquo;setback&rdquo; that required he be admitted to hospital.</p>

<p>The Emir of Kuwait has called on both sides to calm down as tensions between the two arch-enemies in the Arabian Gulf escalate between the United States and Iran. Sheikh Sabah is thought to be the architect of modern Kuwait.</p></description>

		<title>Sheikh Hasina urges nations for integrated role to face COVID</title>

		<pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 13:57:27 +06:00</pubDate>
		<author>Staff Correspondent</author>
		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has urged the nations for an integrated roadmap to tackle COVID-19.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister made the call at a high-level event titled &#39;Financing for Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond&#39; at the UN headquarters on Tuesday.</p>

<p>In a video message recorded earlier, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said, &quot;We need a well-coordinated roadmap to tackle the COVID-19 crisis.&quot; She said the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda could be our blueprint for overcoming this crisis. The UN must play a catalytic role here.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister made six recommendations to overcome the crisis. The six-point proposal placed in the event by the Bangladesh premier are:</p>

<p>Firstly, the G-7, G-20, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, multilateral development banks (MDBs), and international financial institutions (IFIs) should scale up fiscal stimulus, concessional finance, and debt relief measures. The advanced economies must fulfill their 0.7% ODA commitment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Secondly, we need to divert more private finance and investment to the developing countries. We must leverage science, technology, and innovation for closing the digital divide,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>In her third proposal, the prime minister said: &ldquo;We need right policy steps for reversing the downward trend of remittances flow by helping the migrant workers during and in the post-COVID job market.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said fourthly the advanced economies must fulfill their unmet promises regarding duty-free, quota-free market access, technology support, and more accessible financing for developing countries.</p>

<p>In the fifth proposal, the premier said there must be new international support measures for the graduating LDCs to prevent any possible slide back due to the pandemic, at least till 2030.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finally, more vigorous efforts are required to finance climate actions and resilient recovery,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The premier, in her pre-recorded statement, also said Covid-19 has had a drastic impact on Bangladesh&rsquo;s economy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For tackling this situation, we immediately announce a 13.25 billion-dollar stimulus package, equivalent to 4.03% of our GDP,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Apart from widening the regular social-safety net programs, Sheikh Hasina said, the government provided financial support to more than 30 million people, including farmers, laborers, students, teachers, artistes, and journalists, during this pandemic.</p>

<p>At the outset of her speech, the prime minister thanked Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for convening this meeting.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said the launching of the initiative with six focus areas of Financing for Development was very timely and Bangladesh co-led the Discussion Group-1 along with Egypt, Japan, and Spain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We feel it important now to translate our promises into actions,&rdquo; she said.</p></description>

				<h2 style="text-align:justify">Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has urged the nations for an integrated roadmap to tackle COVID-19.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister made the call at a high-level event titled &#39;Financing for Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond&#39; at the UN headquarters on Tuesday.</p>

<p>In a video message recorded earlier, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said, &quot;We need a well-coordinated roadmap to tackle the COVID-19 crisis.&quot; She said the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda could be our blueprint for overcoming this crisis. The UN must play a catalytic role here.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister made six recommendations to overcome the crisis. The six-point proposal placed in the event by the Bangladesh premier are:</p>

<p>Firstly, the G-7, G-20, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, multilateral development banks (MDBs), and international financial institutions (IFIs) should scale up fiscal stimulus, concessional finance, and debt relief measures. The advanced economies must fulfill their 0.7% ODA commitment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Secondly, we need to divert more private finance and investment to the developing countries. We must leverage science, technology, and innovation for closing the digital divide,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>In her third proposal, the prime minister said: &ldquo;We need right policy steps for reversing the downward trend of remittances flow by helping the migrant workers during and in the post-COVID job market.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said fourthly the advanced economies must fulfill their unmet promises regarding duty-free, quota-free market access, technology support, and more accessible financing for developing countries.</p>

<p>In the fifth proposal, the premier said there must be new international support measures for the graduating LDCs to prevent any possible slide back due to the pandemic, at least till 2030.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finally, more vigorous efforts are required to finance climate actions and resilient recovery,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The premier, in her pre-recorded statement, also said Covid-19 has had a drastic impact on Bangladesh&rsquo;s economy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For tackling this situation, we immediately announce a 13.25 billion-dollar stimulus package, equivalent to 4.03% of our GDP,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Apart from widening the regular social-safety net programs, Sheikh Hasina said, the government provided financial support to more than 30 million people, including farmers, laborers, students, teachers, artistes, and journalists, during this pandemic.</p>

<p>At the outset of her speech, the prime minister thanked Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for convening this meeting.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said the launching of the initiative with six focus areas of Financing for Development was very timely and Bangladesh co-led the Discussion Group-1 along with Egypt, Japan, and Spain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We feel it important now to translate our promises into actions,&rdquo; she said.</p>

		<description><p>Emir of Kuwait Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al Sabah has died. &nbsp;He has died at the age of 91, in a hospital in the United States on Tuesday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With great sadness and sorrow, we mourn &hellip; the death of Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, emir of the State of Kuwait,&rdquo; said Sheikh Ali Jarrah al-Sabah, the minister in charge of royal affairs, in a television broadcast.</p>

<p>Since 2007, Sheikh Sabah has been serving as the emir of Kuwait, an oil-rich country in the Arabian Gulf. Earlier, he was admitted to the hospital once in 2019. Al-Sabah then cut short his visit to the United States due to illness, even dropping President Donald Trump from his meeting schedule.</p>

<p>Emir Sheikh Sabah was suffering from various physical complications for a long time. His appendix was removed in 2002. Two years later a pacemaker was replaced in his heart. Urinary tract surgery was performed in a US hospital in 2006.</p>

<p>Born in 1929, Sheikh Sabah is widely regarded as the architect of modern Kuwait&rsquo;s foreign policy &ndash; having served as foreign minister for nearly 40 years between 1963 and 2003 &ndash; when he became prime minister.</p>

<p>A longtime widower, Sheikh Sabah lived for years in a palace known as Dar Salwa, which was named after his daughter Salwa, who died of cancer in 2002. He is survived by two sons.
In August 2019, Kuwait acknowledged Sheikh Sabah suffered an unspecified medical &ldquo;setback&rdquo; that required he be admitted to hospital.</p>

<p>The Emir of Kuwait has called on both sides to calm down as tensions between the two arch-enemies in the Arabian Gulf escalate between the United States and Iran. Sheikh Sabah is thought to be the architect of modern Kuwait.

		<title>Amnesty`s account frozen in India, work shut in `retaliation`</title>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">UK based international human rights organization Amnesty International has halted its all activities in India in retaliation of the crackdown imposed by the Indian government, especially on its financial deals.</p>

<p>It is learned, the Indian government has frozen the accounts of the global rights watchdog alleging the non-registered state under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, which is required for any foreign funding, NDTV reports.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The complete freezing of Amnesty India&#39;s bank accounts by the government of India, which it came to know on Sept 10, brings all the work being done by the organization to a grinding halt.</p>

<p>It was stated on behalf of the organization that, it had been compelled to let go of staff in India and pause all its ongoing campaign and research work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sadly, this enormously important work standing up for victims has been met with the heavy-handed tactics that Indian civil society has become increasingly familiar with &ndash; part of the government&rsquo;s drive to silence critical voices and stoke a climate of fear;&rdquo; said Julie Verhaar, acting secretary-general of Amnesty International, in a statement on Tuesday.</p>

<p>&quot;This is the latest in the incessant witch-hunt of human rights organizations by the government of India over unfounded and motivated allegations,&quot; said Amnesty, claiming that it had complied with all Indian and international laws.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is an egregious and shameful act by the Indian Government, which forces us to cease the crucial human rights work of Amnesty International India for now,&rdquo; said Verhaar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;However, this does not mark the end of our firm commitment to, and engagement in, the struggle for human rights in India. We will be working resolutely to determine how Amnesty International can continue to play our part within the human rights movement in India for years to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The staff of Amnesty India have shown great dignity in the face of a concerted and vicious smear campaign of spurious allegations, raids by various investigative agencies, malicious media leaks, and intimidation without an iota of credible evidence of wrongdoing. No laws have been broken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is learned, Amnesty was accused of linking all government action to its reports critical of the government, raising questions on rights violations during the February Delhi riots and after the end of the special status to Jammu and Kashmir.</p>

<p>According to the Indian home ministry, the organization &quot;got money into India through the FDI (foreign direct investment) route,&quot; which is not allowed in the case of non-profits.</p>

<p>In 2017, the Enforcement Directorate, an investigative agency of the Indian government, froze Amnesty&rsquo;s accounts, after which the rights organization approached the court and won some reprieve. But their accounts were sealed. Last year, the CBI also registered a case against them. According to the complaint, Amnesty International UK allegedly remitted ₹10 crore to Amnesty India entities as FDI without the ministry&#39;s approval.</p>

<p>&quot;Another ₹26 crore has been remitted to Amnesty (India) primarily from UK-based entities without the home ministry&#39;s approval. All such receipts have subsequently been expended on Amnesty&#39;s NGO activities in India in violation of the FCRA,&quot; the complaint says.</p></description>

				<h2 style="text-align:justify">UK based international human rights organization Amnesty International has halted its all activities in India in retaliation of the crackdown imposed by the Indian government, especially on its financial deals.</p>

<p>It is learned, the Indian government has frozen the accounts of the global rights watchdog alleging the non-registered state under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, which is required for any foreign funding, NDTV reports.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The complete freezing of Amnesty India&#39;s bank accounts by the government of India, which it came to know on Sept 10, brings all the work being done by the organization to a grinding halt.</p>

<p>It was stated on behalf of the organization that, it had been compelled to let go of staff in India and pause all its ongoing campaign and research work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sadly, this enormously important work standing up for victims has been met with the heavy-handed tactics that Indian civil society has become increasingly familiar with &ndash; part of the government&rsquo;s drive to silence critical voices and stoke a climate of fear;&rdquo; said Julie Verhaar, acting secretary-general of Amnesty International, in a statement on Tuesday.</p>

<p>&quot;This is the latest in the incessant witch-hunt of human rights organizations by the government of India over unfounded and motivated allegations,&quot; said Amnesty, claiming that it had complied with all Indian and international laws.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is an egregious and shameful act by the Indian Government, which forces us to cease the crucial human rights work of Amnesty International India for now,&rdquo; said Verhaar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;However, this does not mark the end of our firm commitment to, and engagement in, the struggle for human rights in India. We will be working resolutely to determine how Amnesty International can continue to play our part within the human rights movement in India for years to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The staff of Amnesty India have shown great dignity in the face of a concerted and vicious smear campaign of spurious allegations, raids by various investigative agencies, malicious media leaks, and intimidation without an iota of credible evidence of wrongdoing. No laws have been broken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is learned, Amnesty was accused of linking all government action to its reports critical of the government, raising questions on rights violations during the February Delhi riots and after the end of the special status to Jammu and Kashmir.</p>

<p>According to the Indian home ministry, the organization &quot;got money into India through the FDI (foreign direct investment) route,&quot; which is not allowed in the case of non-profits.</p>

<p>In 2017, the Enforcement Directorate, an investigative agency of the Indian government, froze Amnesty&rsquo;s accounts, after which the rights organization approached the court and won some reprieve. But their accounts were sealed. Last year, the CBI also registered a case against them. According to the complaint, Amnesty International UK allegedly remitted ₹10 crore to Amnesty India entities as FDI without the ministry&#39;s approval.</p>

<p>&quot;Another ₹26 crore has been remitted to Amnesty (India) primarily from UK-based entities without the home ministry&#39;s approval. All such receipts have subsequently been expended on Amnesty&#39;s NGO activities in India in violation of the FCRA,&quot; the complaint says.</p>

		<title>Is Bangladesh ready for post-LIBOR era?</title>

		<description><p>The LIBOR (London Inter-Bank Offered Rate) methodology is designed to produce an average rate that is representative of the rates at which large, leading internationally active banks with access to the wholesale, unsecured funding market could fund themselves in such market in particular currencies for certain tenors.</p>

<p>LIBOR is currently calculated for five currencies (USD, GBP, EUR, CHF, and JPY) and for seven tenors in respect of each currency (Overnight/Spot Next, One Week, One Month, Two Months, Three Months, Six Months and 12 Months). This results in the publication of 35 individual rates (one for each currency and tenor combination) every applicable London business day.</p>

<p>Used globally, LIBOR is often referenced in derivative, bond and loan documentation, and in a range of consumer lending instruments such as mortgages and student loans. It is also used as a gauge of market expectation regarding central bank interest rates, liquidity premiums in the money markets and, during periods of stress, as an indicator of the health of the banking system.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>LIBOR concept</p>

<p>Libor was first introduced in1986 when the BBA (British Bankers` Association) launched official commencement of this rate initially in only three currencies viz., US Dollar, GBP and Japanese Yen. Since inception in 1986, this reference rate has not only gained immense popularity but also dominated the world credit market. This rate has covered most debt markets in the world and almost all internationally accepted currencies. About USD 300 trillion loans which include almost all forms of credit ranging from personal loan to corporate loan and even LCs / SBLCs (standby LCs) are priced using Libor. Banks responsible for calculating Libor, commonly known as panel banks, report Libor to British Bankers` Association which averages this rate and releases every business day at 11.45 a.m. However, IBA, Intercontinental Exchange-Benchmark Administration, took over this responsibility form IBA in 2014.&nbsp; After playing dominant role in the world credit market during last three decades, this worldwide accepted reference rate popularly known as Libor is going to die by the end of 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hazard in LIBOR history</p>

<p>In the history of Libor, this world-famous benchmark rate faced severe setback in 2014 when manipulation of Libor was reported. During 2012-14 period, some Forex traders resorted to huge manipulation by posting inflated rate and took undue advantage in their favor. Consequently, about three hundred trillion US dollar loans which are priced using Libor was wrongly priced and as such badly impacted. This unprecedented manipulation occurred when world financial market was scrambling hard to recover from the worst-hit financial crisis that erupted in 2008 in the USA and subsequently swept across the world. This Libor scandal came as a great shock to the policymakers of world financial market, particularly USA and Europe. Because of strong persuasion from US regulator-- US Commodity Trade commission, this Libor manipulation was tried in the UK court where the main accused, a British trader, was sentenced with imprisonment. Many bankers involved with this manipulation were fired and some large banks which were allegedly involved with this manipulation were also severely punished with huge monetary penalty. After this Libor debacle, the death of Libor was thought to be imminent. Think-tanks and market experts were almost certain that at least the USA will not accept it and will come up with alternative rate because lion`s share of international borrowing including US market is denominated in US dollar and priced using Libor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The future of LIBOR</p>

<p>In July 2017, the then Chief Executive Officer of the UK Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA), Andrew Bailey, gave a speech in which he announced that it was the FCA&rsquo;s intention that it would no longer be necessary for the FCA to &ldquo;persuade, or compel, banks to submit to LIBOR&rdquo; after end-2021. The FCA and other official sector bodies have made several announcements since 2017 regarding the need to transition from LIBOR to alternative rates, and market participants have been strongly advised of the need to ensure they are prepared for this transition by the end of 2021.</p>

<p>To facilitate the industry&rsquo;s progress towards an orderly adoption of alternative rates into the financial system, IBA has launched the ICE Term RFR Portal and published a paper showing how IBA can support the development of term structures for alternative rates.</p>

<p>IBA has also engaged with LIBOR Contributor Banks, other global banks and end-users of LIBOR regarding LIBOR transition, and the potential for the continued publication of certain widely-used LIBOR settings after end-2021, if necessary to provide a &lsquo;safety-net&rsquo; for users with outstanding LIBOR-linked contracts that are impossible or impractical to modify (&ldquo;tough legacy contracts&rdquo;). This engagement included a LIBOR-usage survey, which was open to all users of LIBOR and was designed to identify the most widely-used LIBOR settings for which users would like to see IBA work with global banks to potentially support publication after end-2021. The survey closed in February 2019, and the results have been published on IBA&rsquo;s website.</p>

<p>IBA is using the results of the survey and its other outreach work to engage with globally active banks to seek their support to potentially continue to publish certain widely-used LIBOR settings after end-2021, if necessary to provide a safety-net for users with tough legacy contracts. Any such settings will need to be compliant with relevant regulations and in particular those regarding representativeness.</p>

<p>There can be no certainty or guarantee that IBA will be able to obtain such support or publish any LIBOR settings after end-2021. Work on the possible continued publication of certain LIBOR settings is not intended as an alternative to the transition to alternative rates.</p>

<p>Does Bangladesh prepare for post-LIBOR era?</p>

<p>However, the use of LIBOR is coming to an end in 2021. The financial crisis caused a notable reduction in transaction volumes in the unsecured inter-bank lending market. Therefore, LIBOR computation has been primarily based on expert judgment due to insufficient transaction data. Regulators as well as panel banks have expressed concerns that further grew with the 2012 LIBOR scandal. Banks were caught manipulating the rate to enhance their profitability. As a result, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) decided to devise a different method of rate calculation and transition by 2021.</p>

<p>Regardless of the expected consequence from Libor transition, it is obvious that Libor era will end after 2021. From 2022 onward, all new loans and LCs / SBLCs will be priced differently in addition to carrying out entire outstanding loans and LCs / SBLCs with switching Libor to new interest rate. For this exercise and successful transition, preparation is needed.</p>

<p>Besides, this LIBOR transition is expected to have a massive global impact and on Bangladesh as well, whatever may be the market&rsquo;s exposure is likely to be somehow affected. But, does Bangladesh prepared for this transition right now?</p>

<p>The change is going to be significant and will require immediate attention from financial institutions. However, preliminary reports reflect that a majority of banks and other financial institutions in Bangladesh are oblivious to the change and no notable step to make the transition has been taken yet.</p>

<p>Studies report that this wait-and-see approach is risky given the volume of products and processes which require alteration. Bangladesh, though in the short term has lending contracts of $7.5 billion outstanding in recent times, backed by either intra-company borrowing or borrowing from Middle Eastern or European banks.</p>

<p>Regulators of many countries irrespective of the developed and developing world and many financial institutions have already initiated Libor transition process. Many committees and coordinating bodies have already been formed. Bangladesh Bank should maintain liaison with those committees/ bodies, undertake preparatory measures and properly guide market players involved in handling transactions using LIBOR. It is true that the scope of borrowing loans at Libor is very limited in our country.</p>

<p>However, BB`s recent move of relaxing Foreign Exchange Regulation may encourage many reputed corporate borrowers with good credit standing to borrow loan at Libor because of taking advantage of historically low-interest rate from the world financial market. If this loan is continuous in nature and expected to continue in the post-Libor era, some precautionary measures should be put in place in order to face any adverse consequence, arising out of switching the rate.</p>

<p>The Dhaka Interbank Offered Rate (DIBOR), though not very active, is administered by the Bangladesh Foreign Exchange Dealers&rsquo; Association (BAFEDA) and was introduced in 2010. The rate is computed using the same methodology as LIBOR, meaning it is also likely to be open to manipulation. Therefore, with the above-mentioned issues with LIBOR, it is strongly recommended to utilize a more compatible risk-free rate for financial operations.</p>

<p>According to recent predictions published by PwC, the transition away from LIBOR can either be a slow-rolling disaster or a once-in-a-generation opportunity. LIBOR is currently rooted into US$300 trillion dollars&rsquo; worth of financial contracts globally. This must now be re-contracted or closed. The change may cause delays and disruptions to company operations and the cost of capital will be altered significantly. This is because alternative rates will affect contract prices and change the risk management systems of an entity.</p>

<p>However, sketching out a clear roadmap and expected risk identification to transition is a timely need writ now, for all firms. Therefore, with a smooth transition to nearly risk-free rates, firms are likely to have priced contracts moving forward.</p>

<p>While there should not be a large panic about the aforementioned transition, as most global banks are prepared, we in Bangladesh or local banks need to take cognizance of this, especially where there is a need to rewrite contracts and underlying documentation.</p>

<p>The Dhaka Interbank Offered Rate (DIBOR), though not very active, is administered by the Bangladesh Foreign Exchange Dealers&rsquo; Association (BAFEDA) and was introduced in 2010. The rate is computed using the same methodology as LIBOR, meaning it is also likely to be open to manipulation. Therefore, with the above-mentioned issues with LIBOR, it is strongly recommended to utilize a more compatible risk-free rate for financial operations.</p>

<p>According to recent predictions published by PwC, the transition away from LIBOR can either be a slow-rolling disaster or a once-in-a-generation opportunity. LIBOR is currently rooted into US$300 trillion dollars&rsquo; worth of financial contracts globally. This must now be re-contracted or closed. The change may cause delays and disruptions to company operations and the cost of capital will be altered significantly. This is because alternative rates will affect contract prices and change the risk management systems of an entity.</p>

<p>However, sketching out a clear roadmap and expected risk identification to transition is a timely need writ now, for all firms. Therefore, with a smooth transition to nearly risk-free rates, firms are likely to have priced contracts moving forward.</p>

<p>While there should not be a large panic about the aforementioned transition, as most global banks are prepared, we in Bangladesh or local banks need to take cognizance of this, especially where there is a need to rewrite contracts and underlying documentation.</p>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">The High Court on Wednesday set a new date for announcing the verdict on compensation to Jahlam, a jute mill worker who was jailed for nearly three years being a false accused in 26 cases of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC).</p>

<p>A High Court bench comprising Justice FRM Nazmul Ahsan and Justice KM Kamrul Quader has passed the order today (Tuesday) on further hearing of the case on the day of the verdict.</p>

<p>Lawyer Khurshid Alam Khan was present in the court hearing on behalf of the ACC. Lawyer Anisul Hasan took part in the hearing of the case on behalf of BRAC Bank. While lawyer Sheikh Zakir Hossain was represented for Sonali Bank. Deputy Attorney General Barrister Abdullah Al Mahmoud Bashar represented the state.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the High Court fixed September 29 for the verdict on Wednesday (September 23) last. The case was put on case awaiting verdict (CAV) for the announcement of verdict any day after the hearing of the rule on Jahalam&#39;s compensation question, on February 12 this year.</p>

<p>In January 2019, a report was published in a national daily titled &#39;Sir, I am Jahalam, not Salek ...&#39;. The report was brought to the notice of the court by Supreme Court lawyer Amit Das Gupta. The High Court bench summoned the Anti-Corruption Commission officials and four others, including the plaintiff, to explain the matter. The court also issued a rule.</p>

<p>After the appearance of the concerned persons on February 3 of the same year, the High Court ordered the release of Jahalam. Later he wanted to know about the incident from the ACC in the form of an affidavit. He presented it in the form of an affidavit as per the order.</p>

<p>Later, Jahalam directed the ACC to submit FIRs, chargesheets, supplementary chargesheets and documents of all banks in 33 cases of bank loan fraud.</p>

<p>Following this, the High Court sought a report from the ACC on April 17 to find out who was responsible for the Jahalam. Later, the reports of ACC, BRAC Bank, and Sonali Bank were submitted to the court.</p>

<p>It is learned that 33 cases of fraud of around Tk 18 crore of Sonali Bank have been registered against Abu Salek. But instead of Abu Salek, Jahalam has been imprisoned and appearing in court. He is a jute mill worker by profession.</p></description>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">India is bringing in more assault rifles from the United States to bolster its military in the wake of the conflict with China. On Monday, the Union Defense Ministry approved the purchase of an additional 72,000 assault rifles and other weapons.</p>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">Premier League champions Liverpool maintained their 100 percent start to the season with a 3-1 win against Arsenal at Anfield on Monday leaving them level on nine points with pacesetters Everton and Leicester City.</p>

<p>The visitors took the lead through an Alexandre Lacazette strike but Liverpool were in front by the break thanks to goals from Sadio Mane and Andy Robertson while substitute Diogo Jota made sure of the win with a late strike on his debut.</p>

<p>Liverpool created the early openings with Trent Alexander Arnold causing Arsenal problems down their left. His cross was headed goalwards by Virgil van Dijk but David Luiz cleared off the line and then another ball from the full-back was volleyed straight at goalkeeper Bernd Leno by Mane.</p>

<p>However, in the 25th minute, totally against the run of play, Arsenal grabbed the lead when they broke down the left and Robertson miscontrolled Ainsley Matiland-Niles&#39; cross, the ball falling to Lacazette whose scuffed shot deceived keeper Alisson.</p>

<p>Liverpool responded swiftly though, drawing level three minutes later when Mohamed Salah burst in from the left and Leno parried his shot straight into the path of Mane who made no mistake from close range.</p>

<p>Robertson then made up for his mistake when he was picked out by Alexander-Arnold at the far post, chested the cross down and flicked the ball past Leno to make it 2-1 after 34 minutes.</p>

<p>Arsenal made life more difficult for the home side after the break and should have drawn level in the 63rd minute when Lacazette sprung the offside trap but his shot was too easy for Alisson, who parried it to safety.</p>

<p>New Liverpool signing Jota, the Portuguese forward captured from Wolverhampton Wanderers, marked his debut from the bench with the goal that made sure of the win as he struck a well-taken volley from the edge of the box.</p>

<p>&quot;(We were) dominant against a team in form and careful as hell that we did not get caught on the counter-attack,&quot; said Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp.</p>

<p>&quot;Alisson had to make one save, they had two chances in behind but apart from that the football we played was exceptional tonight,&quot; he added.</p>

<p>The Gunners, who won their first two games, have now gone 28 matches without a win away from home against &#39;Big Six&#39; opposition but manager Mikel Arteta saw signs of improvement.</p>

<p>&quot;We were in the game for a big part of the game. The reality is they are superior to us in many aspects. You could see that in some phases,&quot; said the Spaniard.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m really happy in the way the team competed and kept believing. This is the standard we have to reach. We are on a different journey. They&#39;ve been together five years, we&#39;ve had a few months&quot;.</p></description>

		<description><p>Serena Williams began her search for her record-equaling 24th Grand Slam with a challenging win over fellow American Kristie Ahn in the first round of the French Open, reports CNN sports.</p>

<p>The 39-year-old trailed twice by a break in the opening set, eventually winning in a tie break before decisively sweeping aside 28-year-old Ahn.</p>

<p>It took Williams one hour and 41 minutes to eventually surpass Ahn 7-6 (7-3), 6-0 and advance to the second round at Roland Garros.</p>

<p>&quot;The biggest difference was just confidence,&quot; the No.6 seed said afterward. &quot;I just need to play with more confidence, like I&#39;m Serena.</p>

<p>&quot;So that was it. I just started playing like that, and I love the clay and I started playing like it, opening the court and moving and sliding.&quot;</p>

<p>Williams is aiming to tie Margaret Court&#39;s Grand Slam win total of 24. She is just one away with 23.</p>

<p>She came close to equaling the record at the US Open last month, eventually losing in the semifinals to Victoria Azarenka.</p>

<p>Williams has won the French Open three times, the last victory coming in 2015. She lost in the final a year later to Spaniard Garbi&ntilde;e Muguruza.</p>

<p>In the second meeting between the pair in the space of a few weeks -- Williams beat Ahn in the first round of the US Open -- it was the world No.101 who started the fastest.</p>

<p>Having not played on clay since losing to Sofia Kenin in the third round at Roland Garros in May 2019, Williams looked rusty which allowed Ahn to capitalize and race into a 4-2 lead in the opening set.</p>

<p>Williams battled back though, tying the score at 4-4 and after going to a tie-break, clinching the opening set with her seventh ace.</p>

<p>And after getting warmed up, the former world No.1 quickly raced to victory, breaking Ahn&#39;s serve three times in a row and winning the match with her 11th and final ace of the game.</p>

<p>&quot;I have to let go of those expectations. That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m lowering my expectations,&quot; Williams said. &quot;It just means I&#39;m having realistic expectations of not winning every point, every game, every shot.</p>

<p>&quot;It sounds crazy, but, you know, that&#39;s me and that&#39;s what makes me me. I&#39;m me. I&#39;m Serena. At some point, I&#39;m always going to have some level of perfection, but I just need to have a more reasonable level so I cannot put so much stress on me mentally.&quot;</p>

<p>Williams will play Bulgaria&#39;s US Open quarterfinalist Tsvetana Pironkova in the second round.</p></description>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">Microsoft 365 was hit with a significant outage late Monday that affected users&#39; access to multiple services, including Outlook, reports&nbsp;CNN.</p>

<p>By late evening, services appeared to be largely restored: Microsoft tweeted at 9:21 p.m. ET that &quot;most users should be experiencing relief.&quot; The company added that it was &quot;continuing to see significant improvement for affected services.&quot;</p>

<p>Earlier, the company indicated affected services included Outlook.com, Office.com, Power Platform, Dynamics365, and Microsoft Teams including Teams Live Event.</p>

<p>According to Down Detector, a website that tracks internet outages, users reported issues with logging in, server connection, and Outlook. The downtime began around 5 pm ET for Office 365, according to the site.</p>

<p>Microsoft initially attributed the outage to a recent change to the platform, but later indicated it was &quot;not observing an increase in successful connections after rolling back a recent change. We&#39;re working to evaluate additional mitigation solutions while we investigate the root cause.&quot;</p>

<p>A Microsoft spokesperson later told CNN Business that &quot;at this time, we&#39;ve seen no indication that this is the result of malicious activity.&quot;</p></description>

		<title>Loan installment relaxed till Dec</title>

		<description><p>Bangladesh Bank has issued another direction relaxing loan installment till December 31 amid the severe economic crisis due to the long-standing coronavirus outbreak. As a result, the debtor is not bound to repay the loan till next December. If the pre-scheduled the installments are not paid, no one will be default on the loan. Again, no penalty interest or additional fees can be levied on the loan at this time. However, if someone repays the loan and becomes a regular customer, he will have to be removed from the list of defaulting customers.</p>

<p>Due to the coronavirus outbreak, this opportunity was given by Bangladesh Bank till September, today this opportunity has been extended till December. Bangladesh Bank has advised to give interest discount for the customer if anyone pays the installment at this time.</p>

<p>As a result, the number of bank loan defaulters has decreased. Again, the money of many banks is stuck due to non-collection of installments. However, even after this opportunity, good customers are paying regular installments.</p>

<p>According to a circular issued by Bangladesh Bank on Monday, most sectors of the country&rsquo;s economy have been affected due to the coronavirus outbreak, and many industries, services and businesses are not able to conduct their normal activities due to the risk of prolonging its negative impact. For this reason, the class value of the loan, which was on January 1, will not be classified as negative until December 31. However, if the class value of a loan improves, it can be classified according to the appropriate rules. The term of the ongoing and summons loan will be extended from the existing term to 12 months or till 31st December 2020 (whichever comes earlier). In addition, instructions will be given later on the transfer of interest to the income sector and the preservation of security reserves against loans.</p>

<p>The circular says that the installments due this year against the existing term loans on January 2020 will be treated as delays. In this case, the amount and number of installments of the loan will be re-determined from January next year. During the rescheduling, the number of installments payable in the current year will increase by the same number. Even if no installment is paid in the current year, the term borrower will not be considered as a defaulter for those installments.</p>

<p>Other policies will be applicable for charging interest on the loan during this facility. As a result, the banks will not be able to take interest on the income without re-scheduling, one-time repayment, in cases where Bangladesh Bank has restrictions, without charging cash against the loan. At that time no penalty interest or additional fee can be imposed on the loan.</p>

<p>If a customer does not need to avail of these benefits, the loan can be repaid as per the pre-determined repayment schedule or on the basis of the banker-customer relationship.</p>

<p>Instructions will be issued later on the transfer of interest on interest-bearing loans to the income sector during this period and the preservation of security reserves against the loan.</p>

<p>According to Bangladesh Bank, the amount of non-performing loans in the banking sector has increased to Tk 96,117 crore at the end of last June, which is 9.16 percent of the total loans disbursed. At the end of last March, the defaulted loan was 92 thousand 511 crore. Earlier, at the end of last December, the defaulted loan was 94 thousand 331 crore.</p></description>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">Awami League General Secretary and Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said that Awami League President Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is the source of inspiration to the Bengalee nation.</p>

<p>Quader said this on Monday while extending birthday greetings to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a virtual briefing from his official residence in Dhaka.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today is the 74th birthday of Bangabandhu&rsquo;s daughter Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. It is an unforgettable day in the national history of Bangalees,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The Awami League leader said born on this day in 1947, Sheikh Hasina, daughter of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, is the symbol of development as she brought a dignified status for the country in the entire world with glorious achievements.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina opened the door of the golden horizon for the nation and multiplied the nation&rsquo;s self-confidence to go ahead, the minister said, adding that she encouraged the distressed and frustrated people to lead a better life as well as sowing the seeds of dream among them.</p>

<p>The AL general secretary said Sheikh Hasina is the name of the most successful diplomat in the post-1975 period and she is the most successful politician in the last 45 years.</p>

<p>He said Bangladesh has made an unprecedented development and progress under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina will remain in the hearts of Bangalees as long as Bangladesh exists, he added.</p>

<p>The minister said Bangladesh has resolved different longstanding issues with neighbouring countries including land and maritime boundary and enclaves because of the able leadership of the premier. Sheikh Hasina opened the door of potential blue economy, he said.</p>

<p>About the BNP secretary general&rsquo;s remarks that anarchy going on in the country, Quader said the country is going towards prosperity overcoming different natural disasters and pandemic under the leadership of the AL government and that is why BNP is getting jealous.</p>

<p>Terming BNP founder as the father of distortion of history, the AL general secretary said BNP is getting isolated from people day by day because of their politics of falsehood and committing mistakes so that the party workers now do not believe in their leaders.</p></description>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">World&rsquo;s best search engine Google gives the opportunity to its employees to work from home due to the outbreak of coronavirus.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the global epidemic, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, announced that 30 percent of employees would be back in the office by the end of the year. However, as the situation does not improve, he has instructed to work from home until the middle of next year.</p>

<p>A survey was conducted by Google regarding the opening of the office. The results of the survey were published on the &lsquo;Life at Google&rsquo; page on Twitter. There, 20 percent of Google employees say they never want to return to the office. 53 percent of employees are interested to return to the office irregularly. And 10 percent of workers want to join the office. Besides, 15 percent of employees want to attend the office if there is an event.</p>

<p>In an interview with Time magazine, Sundar Pichai said employees can come to the office irregularly. However, the decision of the employees will be given prioritized in this regard.</p>

<p>Google says the office will be redesigned to protect employees from coronavirus. The cafeteria will be closed to avoid crowds. Employees must maintain a 6 feet distance while sitting.</p></description>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">Mahbubey Alam, the 13th Attorney General and longest-serving Chief Legal Officer in the history of Bangladesh has died of coronavirus on Sunday (September 27). After a day of his death, rumors were spreading in the country&#39;s highest court about who would be the country&#39;s 14th attorney general. Analysis is going on in the court over the constitutional post of the state.</p>

<p>According to court sources, lawyers are lobbying at the highest level of the government to hold the post as Attorney General Mahbubey Alam died of coronavirus. In the meantime, the names of some people are being heard very loudly. Among them are three additional Attorney Generals - Murad Reza, Md. Mamtaz Uddin Fakir, SM Munir. Besides, the names of some influential pro-Awami League lawyers are also being heard. Among them are AM Amin Uddin, president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, and MK Rahman, former additional attorney general.</p>

<p>The Attorney General is a constitutional post who gives legal advice to the government on the constitution, general law, international treaties, and other important issues. He also presents at the government&#39;s pay court. The Attorney General is appointed by the President according to article 64.(1).</p>

<p>According to article 64.(1), the President shall appoint a person who is qualified to be appointed as a Judge of the Supreme Court to be Attorney General for Bangladesh. Article 64. (4) states that the Attorney General shall hold office during the pleasure of the President, and shall receive such remuneration as the President may determine.</p>

<p>A former law official, who has long held important positions in the Attorney General&#39;s Office, said Murad Reza, Momtaz Uddin Fakir, and SM Muni are currently serving as additional attorney generals. Among them, Additional Attorney General Murad Reza is ahead in terms of seniority. It is quite certain that he will be the acting Attorney General until the appointment of the next Attorney General.</p>

<p>On January 8, 2009, a week after the Awami League-led grand alliance government took office, the post of Attorney General was changed. The then-senior advocate Mahbubey Alam replaced attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed on January 13, 2009.</p></description>

<h2 style="text-align:justify">It is learned that the recovery plan has been prepared in consultation with the tourism partners under the direction of the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism. If it is implemented, the tourism industry will turn around again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, World Tourism Day has been celebrated across the country on September 27 with the theme &#39;Tourism for Rural Development&#39;.

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has made the treatment of singer Akbar free for the&nbsp;lifetime at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. Akbar has been suffering from various complications including diabetes and kidney disease for long days.</p>

<p>Vocalist Akbar said, &ldquo;Sir (Hanif Sanket) has contacted the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office. He briefed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on my condition in detail. Hon&rsquo;ble Prime Minister has listened to Sir. She allotted a cheque of Tk 2,00,000 for me and made PG (Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital) free for lifetime for treatment. I will be forever grateful to the Prime Minister and Sir (Hanif Sanket).&rdquo;</p>

<p>Akbar said the cheque and documents issued on September 9 were accepted on September 20. An appointment has been made to go to India on October 1.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be grateful to Dipjol Bhai and Zayed Bhai. Dipjol Bhai used to send Tk 10,000 to 20,000 when needed. He will even bear the cost of treatment in India. Inspired by Dipjol Bhai, I have planned to go to India. I hope I will get well with your prayers,&rdquo; Akbar said.</p>

<p>After Eid, singer Akbar was admitted to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Medical College Hospital with various complications including diabetes and kidney disease. He recovered slightly from the hospital and returned home. Now the singer is staying at home.</p>

<p>Akbar wrote on Facebook about Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, &ldquo;Today is the birthday of our honorable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. I pray to Allah to keep her healthy and give him a good life, because I am very grateful to her. We still dream of living because we have a Prime Minister like her. I am an unpopular man. Yet the last time I was sick she helped me a lot. And this time when I fell ill and went to her, she thought of my family and kept my previous savings certificate fixed and gave me a cheque of two lakh taka for new treatment and free treatment for the rest of my life at PG Hospital. We are really blessed to have such a Prime Minister. Allah, keep this compassionate man very well. Amen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Born in Paikgachha, Khulna, Akbar grew up in Jashore. He used to make a living by pulling a rickshaw in Jashore city. He had a habit of singing, though having no proper knowledge. The people of Jashore were fascinated by Akbar&rsquo;s voice. They even called on stage shows.</p>

<p>In 2003, Akbar sang at a program at MM College, Jashore. Singing that song was a turning point for him. One from Bagerhat was impressed by his song. That person wrote a letter about Akbar in the popular magazine show &lsquo;Ittayadi.&rsquo; The program authority then contacted Akbar.</p>

<p>In that year, in &lsquo;Ittayadi&rsquo;, Akbar became popular overnight by singing Kishore Kumar&rsquo;s song &lsquo;Ekdin Pakhi Ure Jabe Je Alashe&rsquo;. At present Akbar lives with his family at Mirpur No. 13 in the capital.</p></description>

		<description><p>SpaceX postponed a launch of 60 Starlink communications satellites Monday from Florida due to thick clouds above the launch pad.</p>

<p>&quot;You can notice on your screen above Falcon nine, we are looking at some pretty cloudy skies,&quot; said Alex Siegel, a senior material planner at SpaceX, just before the launch scrub was announced.</p>

<p>Siegel said SpaceX doesn&#39;t have a new launch date for Starlink, but it does plan to launch a GPS satellite for the U.S. military from Florida on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The Starlink mission liftoff had been planned at 10:22 a.m. EDT from Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center. SpaceX also had called off an attempt to launch the same satellites on Sept. 17 due to problems anticipated for recovering the first-stage booster in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>The successful launch of the 60 satellites would boost the Starlink total in orbit to well over 700.</p>

<p>More Starlink satellites have been launched, but at least 27 of them have deorbited and burned up, according to astronomers.</p>

<p>While the company increases the number of spacecraft in orbit, it also is testing the system with hundreds of Internet users in North America, according to documents SpaceX has filed with the Federal Communications Commission.</p>

<p>The service has &quot;super-low latency and download speeds greater than 100 Mbps,&quot; megabits per second, Kate Tice, a senior program reliability engineer at SpaceX, said during a Starlink launch Sept. 3.</p>

<p>Such speeds are considered sufficient for multiplayer gaming, and SpaceX recently described the speed in a tweet as &quot;fast enough to stream multiple HD movies at once and still have bandwidth to spare.&quot;</p>

<p>Users testing the system have dish-shaped antennas that look like a &quot;UFO on a stick&quot; according to SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk. Initial results of testing are good, Tice said.</p></description>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">Fighting between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh continued on Monday morning after erupting the day before.</p>

<p>The winner in this war seemed so obvious &ndash; Azerbaijan, the oil-rich nation whose defense spending is much larger than the government budget of its impoverished adversary.</p>

<p>But for three decades and against all odds, cash-strapped Armenia defended its unrecognized satellite, Nagorno-Karabakh, a South Caucasus territory north of Turkey and Iran. Dominated by ethnic Armenians, it violently broke away from Azerbaijan after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Because we&rsquo;ve been fighting for our own land,&rdquo; says Gagik, a 47-year-old schoolteacher who lives in Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh&rsquo;s capital that is plagued by blackouts and navigable only via seemingly impassable potholed roads.</p>

<p>Gagik withheld his last name because he does not want &ldquo;the other side&rdquo; to know it.</p>

<p>He calls his unrecognized, Dubai-sized statelet &ldquo;Artsakh&rdquo;, after a medieval Armenian kingdom.</p>

<p>The state let&rsquo;s better-known name can explain a lot about the nature of the conflict.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nagorno&rdquo; means &ldquo;mountainous&rdquo; in Russian, the language of the last imperial master that conquered all of the South Caucasus two centuries ago and remains Armenia&rsquo;s closest ally.</p>

<p>Soviet leader Josef Stalin made Nagorno-Karabakh an autonomous region within Soviet Azerbaijan, surrounded by districts dominated by ethnic Azerbaijanis.</p>

<p>During the perestroika reforms that eventually led to the Soviet collapse, Nagorno-Karabakh held a referendum, voting to secede from Azerbaijan and become part of Armenia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Karabakh&rdquo; means &ldquo;black garden&rdquo; in Turkish, the language of Azerbaijan&rsquo;s closest ally that keeps its border with Armenia locked and its economy isolated.</p>

<p>The two nations share historic and linguistic ties, and Turkey has vehemently supported Azerbaijan in years-long peace talks over Nagorno-Karabakh that have become the Gordian knot of post-Soviet politics.</p>

<p>Gagik joined the ethnic Armenian rebels in 1992 in what was the first open war between two ex-Soviet republics.</p>

<p>They expelled ethnic Azerbaijani civilians from seven adjacent districts, turning them into a sparsely-populated no man&rsquo;s land. The war claimed more than 30,000 lives, displaced hundreds of thousands and ended in 1994 with a shaky, Russia-brokered truce.</p>

<p>But Gagik never laid down his gun. The war kept shouldering, and he spent years between the trenches and teaching.</p>

<p>Annual flareups claimed lives, including those of Gagik&rsquo;s nephew and two cousins. They would take place in spring or summer and involve shootouts, the capturing and swapping of soldiers, and angry diatribes from Armenia and Azerbaijan accusing each other of breaking the ceasefire.</p>

<p>The four international mediators of the conflict &ndash; Russia, Turkey, France and the US, all home to sizeable Armenian diasporas &ndash; would issue statements condemning the violence.</p>

<p>The last flareup in mid-July this year left 17 dead on both sides and involved heavy artillery fire and drone attacks.</p>

<p>Armenia kept supporting Nagorno-Karabakh militarily &ndash; without ever recognising its independence &ndash; while the breakaway region became the crucible of Armenia&rsquo;s politics.</p>

<p>Two former Armenian presidents and dozens of officials were born in Nagorno-Karabakh and fought in the war, and a sizeable portion of Armenian conscripts go to the breakaway region for military service.</p>

<p>At conscription ceremonies, 18 to 20-year-olds sing and dance to celebrate the beginning of what they called &ldquo;their patriotic duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, Gagik left his house and went to the border right after hearing the sound of shelling near Stepanakert and receiving phone calls from rebel commanders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This time, it looks serious,&rdquo; he told Al Jazeera by phone.</p>

<p>Armenia said 16 people had been killed and more than 100 wounded. It declared martial law and a mobilization.</p>

<p>Azerbaijan said it had started a &ldquo;counter-offensive&rdquo; that followed a &ldquo;provocation&rdquo; by Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today, the victorious Azerbaijani army leads a counter-offensive with much success,&rdquo; Azerbaijani President Ilkham Aliyev, who inherited his position &ndash; along with the conflict &ndash; from his father Heydar, told security officials on Sunday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is our historic duty. I said many times that we have to settle the matter so that the Azerbaijani people are satisfied,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>His officials claimed that the Azerbaijani army killed hundreds of separatist and Armenian soldiers, and destroyed drones, helicopters and tanks.</p>

<p>Turkey was quick to condemn Armenia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By adding to its attacks against Azerbaijan, Armenia has shown once again it is the greatest threat to peace and tranquillity in the region,&rdquo; Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan tweeted on Sunday.</p>

<p>But he didn&rsquo;t signal an intention to intervene &ndash; apparently awaiting Russia&rsquo;s response, observers say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ankara will not meddle in the conflict until Russia does. So far, we see a rather restrained response from Moscow,&rdquo; Emil Mustafayev, a political analyst based in the Azerbaijani capital Baku told the EADaily online magazine.</p>

<p>So far, Russia called on both sides to &ldquo;immediately halt fire and begin talks to stabilize the situation&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moscow keeps a military base in Armenia, supplies it with hydrocarbons and remains a magnet for migrant workers from Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh whose remittances keep their families and homelands afloat.</p>

<p>Many average Armenians see Russia as a saviour that prevented the destruction of their culture and religion by Turkey and Iran.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for Russia, there would be no Armenia,&rdquo; Armen Orbelyan, a 52-year-old businessman who exports fruit and vegetables to Moscow, told this reporter in the Armenian capital, Yerevan, in 2017.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan during a 2019 meeting on the sidelines of a session of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council in Yerevan, Armenia [File: Alexei Druzhinin/Sputnik/Kremlin/Reuters]</p>

<p>His words are a mantra repeated by many Armenian politicians, TV anchors and experts.</p>

<p>But some claim Armenia has become a pawn in the Kremlin&rsquo;s geopolitical games. Russia convinced Armenia to limit ties to the European Union and join the Eurasian Union, a Moscow-led free-trade bloc widely seen as a Russian attempt to recreate the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>There is &ldquo;a justified Armenian perception of questionable and unreliable backing from Russia in the event the current fighting expands&rdquo;, said Richard Giragosian, director of the Regional Studies Center, a think-tank in Yerevan.</p>

<p>Azerbaijan seems to have spent years preparing for the offensive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The current order of battle includes much more serious offensive weapons systems, with much greater willingness on the Azerbaijani side to deploy and engage their improved arsenal of weapons,&rdquo; Giragosian said.</p>

<p>Baku apparently hopes the war will be fast and triumphant.</p>

<p>He said that Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia are usually quick to mobilize reservists and volunteers, but that the COVID-19 pandemic presents a major obstacle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many work in Russia or the US and can&rsquo;t return promptly because of the pandemic. And that&rsquo;s the main problem,&rdquo; he said.</p></description>

				<h2 style="text-align:justify">Fighting between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh continued on Monday morning after erupting the day before.</p>

<p>The winner in this war seemed so obvious &ndash; Azerbaijan, the oil-rich nation whose defense spending is much larger than the government budget of its impoverished adversary.</p>

<p>But for three decades and against all odds, cash-strapped Armenia defended its unrecognized satellite, Nagorno-Karabakh, a South Caucasus territory north of Turkey and Iran. Dominated by ethnic Armenians, it violently broke away from Azerbaijan after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Because we&rsquo;ve been fighting for our own land,&rdquo; says Gagik, a 47-year-old schoolteacher who lives in Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh&rsquo;s capital that is plagued by blackouts and navigable only via seemingly impassable potholed roads.</p>

<p>Gagik withheld his last name because he does not want &ldquo;the other side&rdquo; to know it.</p>

<p>He calls his unrecognized, Dubai-sized statelet &ldquo;Artsakh&rdquo;, after a medieval Armenian kingdom.</p>

<p>The state let&rsquo;s better-known name can explain a lot about the nature of the conflict.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nagorno&rdquo; means &ldquo;mountainous&rdquo; in Russian, the language of the last imperial master that conquered all of the South Caucasus two centuries ago and remains Armenia&rsquo;s closest ally.</p>

<p>Soviet leader Josef Stalin made Nagorno-Karabakh an autonomous region within Soviet Azerbaijan, surrounded by districts dominated by ethnic Azerbaijanis.</p>

<p>During the perestroika reforms that eventually led to the Soviet collapse, Nagorno-Karabakh held a referendum, voting to secede from Azerbaijan and become part of Armenia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Karabakh&rdquo; means &ldquo;black garden&rdquo; in Turkish, the language of Azerbaijan&rsquo;s closest ally that keeps its border with Armenia locked and its economy isolated.</p>

<p>The two nations share historic and linguistic ties, and Turkey has vehemently supported Azerbaijan in years-long peace talks over Nagorno-Karabakh that have become the Gordian knot of post-Soviet politics.</p>

<p>Gagik joined the ethnic Armenian rebels in 1992 in what was the first open war between two ex-Soviet republics.</p>

<p>They expelled ethnic Azerbaijani civilians from seven adjacent districts, turning them into a sparsely-populated no man&rsquo;s land. The war claimed more than 30,000 lives, displaced hundreds of thousands and ended in 1994 with a shaky, Russia-brokered truce.</p>

<p>But Gagik never laid down his gun. The war kept shouldering, and he spent years between the trenches and teaching.</p>

<p>Annual flareups claimed lives, including those of Gagik&rsquo;s nephew and two cousins. They would take place in spring or summer and involve shootouts, the capturing and swapping of soldiers, and angry diatribes from Armenia and Azerbaijan accusing each other of breaking the ceasefire.</p>

<p>The four international mediators of the conflict &ndash; Russia, Turkey, France and the US, all home to sizeable Armenian diasporas &ndash; would issue statements condemning the violence.</p>

<p>The last flareup in mid-July this year left 17 dead on both sides and involved heavy artillery fire and drone attacks.</p>

<p>Armenia kept supporting Nagorno-Karabakh militarily &ndash; without ever recognising its independence &ndash; while the breakaway region became the crucible of Armenia&rsquo;s politics.</p>

<p>Two former Armenian presidents and dozens of officials were born in Nagorno-Karabakh and fought in the war, and a sizeable portion of Armenian conscripts go to the breakaway region for military service.</p>

<p>At conscription ceremonies, 18 to 20-year-olds sing and dance to celebrate the beginning of what they called &ldquo;their patriotic duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, Gagik left his house and went to the border right after hearing the sound of shelling near Stepanakert and receiving phone calls from rebel commanders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This time, it looks serious,&rdquo; he told Al Jazeera by phone.</p>

<p>Armenia said 16 people had been killed and more than 100 wounded. It declared martial law and a mobilization.</p>

<p>Azerbaijan said it had started a &ldquo;counter-offensive&rdquo; that followed a &ldquo;provocation&rdquo; by Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today, the victorious Azerbaijani army leads a counter-offensive with much success,&rdquo; Azerbaijani President Ilkham Aliyev, who inherited his position &ndash; along with the conflict &ndash; from his father Heydar, told security officials on Sunday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is our historic duty. I said many times that we have to settle the matter so that the Azerbaijani people are satisfied,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>His officials claimed that the Azerbaijani army killed hundreds of separatist and Armenian soldiers, and destroyed drones, helicopters and tanks.</p>

<p>Turkey was quick to condemn Armenia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By adding to its attacks against Azerbaijan, Armenia has shown once again it is the greatest threat to peace and tranquillity in the region,&rdquo; Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan tweeted on Sunday.</p>

<p>But he didn&rsquo;t signal an intention to intervene &ndash; apparently awaiting Russia&rsquo;s response, observers say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ankara will not meddle in the conflict until Russia does. So far, we see a rather restrained response from Moscow,&rdquo; Emil Mustafayev, a political analyst based in the Azerbaijani capital Baku told the EADaily online magazine.</p>

<p>So far, Russia called on both sides to &ldquo;immediately halt fire and begin talks to stabilize the situation&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moscow keeps a military base in Armenia, supplies it with hydrocarbons and remains a magnet for migrant workers from Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh whose remittances keep their families and homelands afloat.</p>

<p>Many average Armenians see Russia as a saviour that prevented the destruction of their culture and religion by Turkey and Iran.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for Russia, there would be no Armenia,&rdquo; Armen Orbelyan, a 52-year-old businessman who exports fruit and vegetables to Moscow, told this reporter in the Armenian capital, Yerevan, in 2017.</p>

<p>His words are a mantra repeated by many Armenian politicians, TV anchors and experts.</p>

<p>But some claim Armenia has become a pawn in the Kremlin&rsquo;s geopolitical games. Russia convinced Armenia to limit ties to the European Union and join the Eurasian Union, a Moscow-led free-trade bloc widely seen as a Russian attempt to recreate the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>There is &ldquo;a justified Armenian perception of questionable and unreliable backing from Russia in the event the current fighting expands&rdquo;, said Richard Giragosian, director of the Regional Studies Center, a think-tank in Yerevan.</p>

<p>Azerbaijan seems to have spent years preparing for the offensive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The current order of battle includes much more serious offensive weapons systems, with much greater willingness on the Azerbaijani side to deploy and engage their improved arsenal of weapons,&rdquo; Giragosian said.</p>

<p>Baku apparently hopes the war will be fast and triumphant.</p>

<p>He said that Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia are usually quick to mobilize reservists and volunteers, but that the COVID-19 pandemic presents a major obstacle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many work in Russia or the US and can&rsquo;t return promptly because of the pandemic. And that&rsquo;s the main problem,&rdquo; he said.</p>

		<title>Donald Trump paid no income tax in 10 yrs</title>
		<link>donald-trump-paid-no-income-tax-in-10-yrs/52</link>

		<author>International Desk</author>
		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">The New York Times has reported that US President Donald Trump paid only $750 in federal income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, citing tax return data.</p>

<p>Trump also paid no income taxes in 10 of the last 15 years, the newspaper reported on Sunday, despite receiving $427.4m through 2018 from his reality television program and other endorsement and licensing deals.</p>

<p>The US president is worth an estimated $2.1bn &ndash; down by $1bn during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the latest estimate by Forbes magazine.</p>

<p>For years, Trump has refused to make public his tax records and has fought legal efforts compelling him to do so, saying they are under audit.</p>

<p>According to the New York Times report, Trump was able to minimize his tax bill by reporting heavy losses across his business empire.</p>

<p>The Times reported Trump claimed $47.4m in losses in 2018, despite claiming income of at least $434.9m in a financial disclosure that year</p>

<p>The newspaper reported that the president is also facing a &ldquo;decade-long audit battle with the Internal Revenue Service over the legitimacy of a $72.9m tax refund that he claimed, and received, after declaring huge losses.&rdquo; It said an adverse ruling &ldquo;could cost him more than $100m&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With his financial challenges mounting, the records show that he depends more and more on making money from businesses that put him in potential and often direct conflict of interest with his job as president.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At a press conference on Sunday, Trump denied the report.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fake news, it&rsquo;s totally fake news. Made up. Fake,&rdquo; he told reporters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Actually, I paid tax, and you&rsquo;ll see that as soon as my tax returns &ndash; It&rsquo;s under audit, they&rsquo;ve been under audit for a long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said in a statement to the New York Times that &ldquo;most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over the past decade, President Trump has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government, including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015,&rdquo; Mr Garten said in a statement.</p>

<p>The report comes at a pivotal moment ahead of the first of three presidential debates on Tuesday, and weeks before the November 3 presidential election.</p>

<p>The Times said it had obtained tax-return data covering more than 20 years for Trump and companies within his business organization.</p>

<p>It did not have information about his personal returns from 2018 or 2019.</p>

<p>Al Jazeera&rsquo;s Heidi Zhou Castro, reporting from the state of Maryland, said that the report is sending &ldquo;shockwaves&rdquo; across the country, adding that many middle-class American families pay, on average, $14,000 in federal taxes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How he did this, a self-proclaimed multi-billionaire, is indeed an act of wizardry, as the newspaper describes,&rdquo; Castro said.</p>

<p>Jeremy Mayer, a professor of politics at George Mason University, told Al Jazeera that while it would be hard for the president to dismiss the latest report, he could still get away with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This would destroy a normal candidate for the presidency, to have this information come out just a few weeks before the election. Anyone running for re-election, it would be over. The question tonight is, will this finally matter with Republican voters, and I honestly don&rsquo;t know the answer to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mayer said that the easiest way for Trump to refute the allegations in the report is to release his tax returns.</p>

<p>The report also said that during his first two years as president, Trump received $73m from foreign operations, which in addition to his golf properties in Scotland and Ireland included $3m from the Philippines, $2.3m from India and $1m from Turkey, among other nations.</p>

<p>The president in 2017 paid $145,400 in taxes in India and $156,824 in the Philippines, compared with just $750 in US income taxes. The Times said the tax records did not reveal any unreported connections to Russia.</p>

<p>Trump found multiple ways to reduce his tax bills. He has taken tax deductions on personal expenses such as housing, aircraft and $70,000 to style his hair while he filmed television reality show, The Apprentice.</p>

<p>Losses in the property businesses solely owned and managed by Trump appear to have offset income from his stake in The Apprentice and other entities with multiple owners.</p>

<p>In a statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, of the opposition Democratic Party, said the latest revelations about Trump&rsquo;s taxes showed his &ldquo;disdain for America&rsquo;s working families.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Richard Neal, a Democratic congressman and the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee who has tried unsuccessfully to obtain Trump&rsquo;s tax records, said the Times report makes it even more essential for his committee to get the documents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It appears that the President has gamed the tax code to his advantage and used legal fights to delay or avoid paying what he owes,&rdquo; Neal wrote in a statement.</p>

<p>During his first general election debate against Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016, Clinton said that perhaps Trump was not releasing his tax returns because he had paid nothing in federal taxes.</p></description>

<p>&ldquo;With his financial challenges mounting, the records show that he depends more and more on making money from businesses that put him in potential and often direct conflict of interest with his job as president.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At a press conference on Sunday, Trump denied the report.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fake news, it&rsquo;s totally fake news. Made up. Fake,&rdquo; he told reporters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Actually, I paid tax, and you&rsquo;ll see that as soon as my tax returns &ndash; It&rsquo;s under audit, they&rsquo;ve been under audit for a long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said in a statement to the New York Times that &ldquo;most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over the past decade, President Trump has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government, including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015,&rdquo; Mr Garten said in a statement.</p>

<p>The report comes at a pivotal moment ahead of the first of three presidential debates on Tuesday, and weeks before the November 3 presidential election.</p>

<p>The Times said it had obtained tax-return data covering more than 20 years for Trump and companies within his business organization.</p>

<p>It did not have information about his personal returns from 2018 or 2019.</p>

<p>Al Jazeera&rsquo;s Heidi Zhou Castro, reporting from the state of Maryland, said that the report is sending &ldquo;shockwaves&rdquo; across the country, adding that many middle-class American families pay, on average, $14,000 in federal taxes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How he did this, a self-proclaimed multi-billionaire, is indeed an act of wizardry, as the newspaper describes,&rdquo; Castro said.</p>

<p>Jeremy Mayer, a professor of politics at George Mason University, told Al Jazeera that while it would be hard for the president to dismiss the latest report, he could still get away with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This would destroy a normal candidate for the presidency, to have this information come out just a few weeks before the election. Anyone running for re-election, it would be over. The question tonight is, will this finally matter with Republican voters, and I honestly don&rsquo;t know the answer to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mayer said that the easiest way for Trump to refute the allegations in the report is to release his tax returns.</p>

<p>The report also said that during his first two years as president, Trump received $73m from foreign operations, which in addition to his golf properties in Scotland and Ireland included $3m from the Philippines, $2.3m from India and $1m from Turkey, among other nations.</p>

<p>The president in 2017 paid $145,400 in taxes in India and $156,824 in the Philippines, compared with just $750 in US income taxes. The Times said the tax records did not reveal any unreported connections to Russia.</p>

<p>Trump found multiple ways to reduce his tax bills. He has taken tax deductions on personal expenses such as housing, aircraft and $70,000 to style his hair while he filmed television reality show, The Apprentice.</p>

<p>Losses in the property businesses solely owned and managed by Trump appear to have offset income from his stake in The Apprentice and other entities with multiple owners.</p>

<p>In a statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, of the opposition Democratic Party, said the latest revelations about Trump&rsquo;s taxes showed his &ldquo;disdain for America&rsquo;s working families.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Richard Neal, a Democratic congressman and the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee who has tried unsuccessfully to obtain Trump&rsquo;s tax records, said the Times report makes it even more essential for his committee to get the documents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It appears that the President has gamed the tax code to his advantage and used legal fights to delay or avoid paying what he owes,&rdquo; Neal wrote in a statement.</p>

<p>During his first general election debate against Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016, Clinton said that perhaps Trump was not releasing his tax returns because he had paid nothing in federal taxes.</p>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">In addition to the Drugs Connection in Bollywood, there are also people associated with many B-grade films on the NCB radar. The number may be more than 50. At the same time, the names of many actors-actresses and producers have been added to this list; reports Indian news media News 18.</p>

<p>Many celebrities in Bollywood have lost sleep as their names are coming to the fore one after another in connection to the NCB drug cases.&nbsp; Rhea Chakraborty and drug dealers involved in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case have revealed the names of many big Bollywood stars in an investigation by the Narcotics Control Bureau.&nbsp; According to them, there are currently 50 Bollywood celebrities on the NCB radar.&nbsp; This includes the names of many big actors-actresses, producers-directors.</p>

<p>According to that source, there are people associated with many B-grade films on the NCB radar in the drug racket of Bollywood.&nbsp; According to NCB sources, Bollywood has a huge network of drugs and this number may be more than 50.&nbsp; At the same time, many actors-actresses and producers are also on the list.&nbsp; Now soon the NCB will start calling them in the interest of investigation.</p>

<p>NCB has filed two FIRs in this incident.&nbsp; One of these FIRs is a drug case related to the death of Sushant Singh Rajput.&nbsp; Riya Chakraborty, her brother Shauvik Chakraborty, Samuel Miranda and many others have been arrested in the case.&nbsp; It also has revealed the names of Sara Ali Khan and Shraddha Kapoor.&nbsp; And they have been grilled too.</p>

<p>At the same time, a second FIR has been lodged regarding the use and supply of dresses in Bollywood.&nbsp; It has many names like Deepika Padukone and Rakulpreet Singh.&nbsp; They have already been grilled in NCB custody.

According to sources, he had a 24-hour meeting with NCB officials in Mumbai on Sunday.</p>

<p>The CBI still has no evidence of murder in the Sushant Singh Rajput case.&nbsp; In such a situation, the CBI is now leaning towards suicide.&nbsp; The CBI will now investigate who persuaded Sushant to commit suicide in such a situation.</p>

		<description><p>Bangladesh cricket team is not going to tour Sri Lanka. Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Nazmul Hasan Papon confirmed the matter on Monday. He said it is not possible to visit the country in the current situation.</p>

<p>Earlier, Board president Nazmul Hasan Papon visited BCB and held talks with board officials on the occasion of the birthday of Prime Minister and Father of the Nation Bangabandhu&#39;s daughter Sheikh Hasina. There he held an unscheduled meeting with the board of directors. Where almost all the directors of the board were present. He told reporters after the board&#39;s discussion that the tigers would not visit Sri Lanka for the time being.</p>

<p>At the time, Nazmul Hasan Papon said, &quot;Sri Lanka said yesterday that they will be able to accept everything except one condition.&quot; But that is the main condition. That is 14 days quarantine. However, it is not possible to accept. This is also what we have informed today.</p>

<p>Papon added that this is actually a matter for their task force. Their quarantine is not just about staying at home. Stay in full isolation. That means no one can leave the room. There can be no cricketer like that. It&#39;s not just that he will have a fitness problem. He will also become mentally ill. So it is not possible to play a series of Test championships in this way. So I told them to reschedule the schedule. If the situation is normalized then the series can be thought of.</p>

<p>Earlier, the Sri Lanka Cricket Board had laid down various conditions for the tour during the coronavirus outbreak. On the other hand, the BCB said that they will not send a team to Sri Lanka on the terms given by the Lanka Board. After that there was uncertainty about this tour.</p>

<p>The tour was supposed to be for three Tests of the ICC Test Championship. The test was likely to start on October 24. But at the end, it became clear that the Tigers are not going to Sri Lanka.</p></description>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">The court today has sentenced Regent Hospital Chairman Shahed alias Shahed Karim to life imprisonment in an arms case.</p>

<p>Judge KM Imrul Kayesh of Dhaka&#39;s No. 1 Special Tribunal pronounced the verdict on Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>Earlier, the court had fixed September 20 as the date of the verdict after presenting the arguments of the state and the accused.</p>

<p>Testimony in the case ended on September 15. The court heard the testimony of 11 out of 14 witnesses in the case in four working days.</p>

<p>Earlier on July 30, DB Police Inspector Shairul Islam, the investigation officer of the case, filed the chargesheet to Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate&#39;s Court. Then the court started the trial on August 28 by framing charges against Shahed.</p>

<p>It is worth to mention that, Shahed was arrested from the Debhata border in Satkhira on the morning of July 15. The next day, the court granted Shahed a 10-day remand in a case filed on various charges of fraud, including fake reports in the name of the coronavirus test. Police recovered weapons and drugs in a raid in Uttara on the night of July 18 with Shahed who was then in remand. Later, Metropolitan Detective Police Inspector SM Gaffarul Alam filed an arms case against him.</p></description>

		<title>Sheikh Hasina: Legend in politics, ‘Mother of Humanity’</title>
		<link>sheikh-hasina-legend-in-politics-mother-of-humanity/39</link>
		<guid>d4447116f07ffd39adc37bfe11b02be8</guid>
		<pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2020 19:33:42 +06:00</pubDate>
		<author>Rz Prince</author>
		<description><p>Sheikh Hasina&nbsp;the eldest child&nbsp;of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Founding Father of Bangladesh and the first president of Bangladesh, and Sheikh Fazilatunnesa Mujib was born at Tungipara in Gopalganj on September 28 in 1947. She has passed her whole child living in the village of&nbsp;Gopalganj.&nbsp;As she said in many interviews that she had grown up in fear due to her father&rsquo;s political works. During the peak of violence of the 1970 Elections in Pakistan as well as her father&rsquo;s arrest she had lived in refuge with her grandmother. She says, &ldquo;I was not allowed to go to the school. Because I had to cross the canal by a wooden bridge, she was very much afraid that if I fall from this wooden bridge I will fall in the river&rdquo;. She was active in the student politics of Dhaka University. Hasina was not in Bangladesh when her great father was assassinated barbarically on 15 August 1975. She was not allowed to return to the country until after she was elected to lead the Awami League on 16 February 1981 and returned to Bangladesh on 17 May 1981.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<figure><img></figure>

<p>&ldquo;If Rabi Thakur is the poet of</p>

<p>reflection and thoughts, if</p>

<p>Bangabandhu is the poet of politics,</p>

<p>then Sheikh Hasina is the poet of development.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Post liberation war politics and Sheikh Hasina</p>

<p>The Awami League has been described as a &ldquo;left-of-center&rdquo; political party. Hasina was in and out of detention throughout the 1980s. In 1984, Hasina was put under house arrest in February and again in November. In March 1985, she was put under house arrest for three months in the Ershad regime. Ershad dissolved the parliament in December 1987. During November and December that year, a mass political uprising took place in Dhaka demanding a fresh general election under a neutral caretaker government. Several people were killed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1st caretaker government</p>

<p>After several years of autocratic rule, widespread protests and strikes created so much unrest that the economy was not functioning. A huge mass protest in December 1990 ousted General Ershad from the power, who resigned in favor of selected Vice President Justice Shahabuddin. The caretaker government, headed by Shahabuddin Ahmed, the Chief Justice of the Bangladesh Supreme Court, administered a general election for the parliament. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) led by Khaleda Zia won a general majority, and Hasina&rsquo;s Awami League emerged as the largest opposition party. In 1996 elections, the Awami League, with other opposition parties, demanded that the next general elections be held under a neutral caretaker government, and that provision for caretaker governments to manage elections be incorporated in the constitution. The ruling BNP refused to act on these demands. Opposition parties launched an unprecedented campaign, calling strikes for weeks on end. The government accused them of destroying the economy while the opposition countered that BNP could solve this problem by acceding to their demands. In late 1995, the MPs of the Awami League and other parties resigned from the parliament. Parliament completed its term and a general election was held on 15 February 1996. The election was boycotted by all major parties except the ruling BNP. Hasina described the election as a farce.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2nd caretaker government</p>

<p>The new parliament, composed mostly of BNP members, amended the constitution to create provisions for a caretaker government (CTG). The next parliamentary elections on 30 June 1996 were held under a neutral caretaker government headed by retired chief Justice Muhammad Habibur Rahman. Sheikh Hasina served her first term as prime minister of Bangladesh from 1996-2001. She signed the 30 year water sharing treaty of the Ganges with India. Her administration repealed the Indemnity Act, which protected the killers of the country&rsquo;s Founding Father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Muijibur Rahman, her father and the first president of Bangladesh. Her government opened the telecom industry to the private sector which till then was limited to government-owned companies. In 1999 the government started the New Industrial Policy (NIP) which aimed to strengthen the private industry and encourage growth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3rd caretaker government</p>

<p>During her second term as leader of the opposition, political unrest and violence increased. Ahsanullah Master, an MP, was killed in 2004. This was followed by a grenade attack on 21 August on an Awami League gathering in Dhaka, resulting in the death of 21 party supporters, including party women&rsquo;s secretary Ivy Rahman. Shah M S Kibria, Hasina&rsquo;s former finance minister, was also killed that year, in a grenade attack in Sylhet that year. Caretaker government and military intervention happened in October 2006&ndash;2008. The months preceding the planned 22 January 2007 elections were filled with political unrest and controversy. Following the end of Khaleda Zia&rsquo;s government in late October 2006, there were protests and strikes, during which 40 people were killed in the following month, over uncertainty about who would head the caretaker government.</p>

<p>The caretaker government had difficulty bringing the all parties to the table. Awami League and its allies protested and alleged that the caretaker government favored the BNP. Later in the month, the president Tajuddin Ahmed imposed a state of emergency. Political activity was prohibited. Fakhruddin Ahmed became the chief advisor of the caretaker government. On 16 July 2007, Hasina was arrested by state police at her home and taken before a local court in Dhaka. She was accused of extortion and denied bail, and was held in a building converted into a jail on the premises of the National Parliament. The Awami League said the arrest was politically motivated. On 17 July 2007, the Anti-Corruption Commission sent notices to both Hasina and Khaleda Zia, instructing them to provide details of their assets to the Commission within one week.</p>

<p>On 30 July 2007, the Dhaka High Court suspended Hasina&rsquo;s extortion trial and ordered her release on bail. On 2 September 2007, an additional case was filed against Hasina by the Anti-Corruption Commission regarding the awarding of a contract for the construction of a power plant in 1997, for which she allegedly took a bribe of 30 million takas and kept the contract from going to the lowest bidder. Six others were also accused of involvement. A graft case was filed against Begum Zia on the same day. On 13 January 2008, Hasina was indicted on extortion charges by a special court along with two of her relatives, her sister Sheikh Rehana and her cousin Sheikh Selim. On 6 February, the High Court stopped the trial, ruling that she could not be prosecuted under emergency laws for crimes alleged to have been committed prior to the imposition of the state of emergency.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9th national parliamentary elections, 2008 and digital Bangladesh by 2021</p>

<p>On 11 June 2008, Hasina was released on parole for medical reasons. The next day she flew to the United States to be treated for hearing impairment, eye problems and high blood pressure. On 6 November 2008, Hasina returned to Bangladesh to attend the Ninth National Parliamentary Elections 2008 scheduled for 29 December 2008 and decided to participate in the parliamentary election under the name of &ldquo;Grand Alliance&rdquo; comprising 14 political parties. On 11 December 2008, Hasina formally announced her party&rsquo;s election manifesto during a news conference and vowed to build a &ldquo;Digital Bangladesh&rdquo; by 2021. Her Bangladesh Awami League and its Grand Alliance won the general election held on 29 December 2008 with a two-thirds majority, numerically the party controls 230 seats out of 299.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>10th Parliamentary election in 2014</p>

<p>Throughout most of 2013, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its alliance of 18 opposition parties led by BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia called more than 85 days of nationwide general strikes and blockades that brought the entire country to a grinding halt. Despite thousands of objections and demands by the opposition parties aiming to throw the state in a vacuum of politics, the Sheikh Hasina&#39;s expertise in politics and leadership save the country as well as countrymen from a crisis of sovereignty. Since the ninth parliament&#39;s mandate expires on 24 January 2014, according to the constitution of Bangladesh&#39;s Article 123(2)(a) requires a general election to be held between the dates of 26 October 2013 and 24 January 2014 or rather within 90 days before the expiration of the Parliament.[9] On 25 November 2013, the Bangladesh Election Commission announced that the 10th general election would be held on 5 January 2014. But all the opposition except Ershad led Jatiya Party, boycotted the election. As a result of the boycott, the then incumbent Bangladesh Awami League won the election with a safe majority, winning 234 seats.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>11th Parliamentary Election</p>

<p>The 11th parliamentary of Bangladesh Jatiya Sangsad was held on 30th December 2019. From the lesson of boycotting the previous election in 2014, the opposition BNP took the earlier decision to participate in the 11th election. Due to the constitutional obligation, the election commission, one of the independent agencies of the state, organized the election in the scheduled time. In the election, the people of Bangladesh expressed their comprehensive support to the Awami League, the party of Liberation war through the franchise. Under the tactical leadership of Shaikh Hasina, Awami League won the election in a huge margin of 258 seats out of 300.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina&rsquo;s masterful politics</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina can work which rings around all of us who consider themselves as politicians. In her work is so stark one can smell the effluvia of the salted herring, breathe in the clean, cool sea air, and sink into the homey chairs at the local inns. One can also feel her emotional pain. She not only changes lives, she changes history. She belongs to those women who, by refusing to play by the rules that society handed to them, forever have altered the course of history. Hers is a women&rsquo;s history, sure, but it is also a critical piece of Bangladesh&rsquo;s History. Her story demonstrates how women in history are overlooked. Her gift to humanity has to be recognized to honor her work. Imagine being so famous and important she has an era be named after her name. You would either have to be incredibly lucky or really good. Hasina is probably both. She has created the persona of Sheikh Hasina, a woman who says little and makes few strong alliances. She is masterful at keeping her enemies at bay.</p>

<p>These discussions are relevant today. A significant amount of historical narrative is still being written by those with the most power. If you walk into any of the world&rsquo;s most powerful institutions (government, academic or corporate) you will also identify that the group that are shaping history are Bangladesh&rsquo;s women. No woman is known in the history of Bangladesh&rsquo;s reactions and responses to the foreign power better than Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>She not only changes lives, she changes history. She belongs to those women who, by refusing to play by the rules that society handed to them, forever have altered the course of history.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina is like a rock</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina is like a rock. If you strike a woman, you strike a rock. She is not a woman but a world. A strong, visionary, spirited woman whose transcendental life, or whose legendary stories, have elevated mankind with their mystique, incomparable ethereal beauty, wisdom, wit, virtue, grace, talent, kindness or exceptional courage. Start your &ldquo;Extraordinary Heroines&rdquo; genealogical journey, experience past worlds, stroll through the annals of world history to meet the remarkable ancestors upon whose stalwart shoulders we stand today. She personifies outstanding attributes of her times to help you capture the spirit of the times, and the mood of the moment. We will encounter the influence and persuasiveness of her power through the ages. Be awed by the transcendental qualities of the breathtaking, bold, brave women of the sacred Scriptures, and the powerful women icons of ancient, classical and civilizations. Admire the zealous, valiant, spirited, pioneering, wise women of the middle ages who paved the way for the passionate, creative, revolutionary, luminary Renaissance Thinkers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her ideas and experience are interesting and valuable</p>

<p>When you are sitting with her ... she makes you feel like your ideas and your experience are interesting and valuable. She emboldens lots of young women who are often at the bottom of the totem poll ... to feel confident enough about themselves that they have gone on to be on television or to change governments. She has made general people feel happy and cheerful.</p>

<p>She is a very courageous woman&hellip;She is a politician the country has ever produced! She is loyal to her country and knows exactly what it stands for. To me, a hero or a heroine is someone who is respected and does not care what others think. A hero or a heroine is someone who has done things that have made a difference, thinks for themselves, and of course, has a sense of style. The one person who matches every one of these traits is a Bengali of Bangladesh. However, this is not what she has to be remembered for. Sheikh Hasina has to be remembered for being herself. She represents her strong-mindedness and her wise decision-making ability.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her flawless political endeavors</p>

<p>She has been throwing and catching several objects simultaneously in her political pursuits with her political roles and activism and intertwining all her various endeavors flawlessly. Gender disparities still exist. Such disparities undermine not only women&rsquo;s capacity to participate in and benefit from development, but also the effectiveness of development as a whole. This is the reason for the PM Hasina&rsquo;s insistence that illiteracy must be eliminated within a short period of time. She also feels that the general public still doesn&rsquo;t view women as fully credible within the political spectrum. She has been trying to implement programs promoting the contributions and capacities of women to help sway the general public away from archaic male-biased ideologies. In everything she does, Hasina is devoted to promoting the advancement of women. She uses her various political pursuits, her political prominence, her Bangladesh&rsquo;s and international connections, as well as her passionate grass-roots approach -- towards supporting female empowerment in public policies, education, science, technology, public service, culture, and within society as a whole.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A woman who does not hand out aid</p>

<p>She is a woman who does not hand out aid. She has been creating innovative new ways for women &ndash; and men &ndash; to lift themselves out of poverty. What is a hero? Webster&rsquo;s Collegiate Dictionary defines a hero as, &ldquo;A Myth. Legend. A man (or woman) of great strength or courage&hellip;&rdquo; Whom do you think of? Some might think of Superman or Gandalf. Others would say firefighters or policemen - anyone who risks their life to save someone else. My definition of a hero is someone who, even in the face of opposition, perseveres in the job people have laid out for them, continuing to trust in them. One of the people I most admire is Sheikh Hasina. Throughout all her life, she has done things for other people and not for herself. When I hear the word &ldquo;hero&rdquo; I instantly think of the three H&rsquo;s: someone who is honorable, hardworking, and happy. When I think more about this word I picture someone who has accomplished good things for people and tries to do the right thing. Hasina is one person whom I find to be very heroic.</p>

<p>She seems proper and serious, even stern at times, but inside her, there seems to be a completely different person; a caring lady who is interested in other people&rsquo;s lives.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina believes in the future welfare of Bangladesh</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina believes that the future welfare of Bangladesh is in great part also dependent on the economic development and success of its citizens, and likewise, they are also working to improve economic conditions for the less fortunate. Her works have not gone unnoticed by the world either. In fact, she has received a number of awards and commendations for her works. She merges the roles of wife, mother, philanthropist, activist, and of course, she, seamlessly, with all facets of her life given equal dedication. As a crusader for the rights of women and children, an advocate of advancements in education, technology, and healthcare, a promoter of entrepreneurship and microfinance, and a forerunner in the battle to eradicate poverty and to bridge educational and other divides, it is clear why so many consider Sheikh Hasina to be a role model, not only for people in the South Asia, but for people everywhere. She is incredibly passionate about her work, which is what I think inspires many people to get involved and support her work.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s clear the people who go through her work love her, too &ndash; they flock to her like a den mother! She is a great woman, who will forever be remembered for helping others. When someone thinks of a hero they usually think of someone who wears a mask, a cape or has superpowers, but I think a hero is someone who pushes you to be the best you can be, or to do what you want to do without caring about who you are, what you do, or how old you are.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her motivation and direction to achieve larger goals</p>

<p>Whether they led a country, history&rsquo;s best leaders understood the importance of providing the motivation and direction to achieve larger goals. Poor leaders lose the faith and trust of the people they lead, while great leaders seem to lead without effort. The character, actions and thoughts of a leader, good or bad, permeate an organization. Your goal should be to demonstrate the best qualities of a leader while encouraging the same from those who follow you. A political leader, or a politician, can be anyone who has taken up the responsibility of governing a tribe, city, state, region or even an entire nation. History has given us a plethora of political leaders, both good and bad, who have dedicated their lives to the betterment of their countries and the people living in the country. Political leaders are not just people who govern nations during peace times but also during times of crisis.</p>

<p>They are people who are responsible for making and implementing strategies and policies meant to better serve the interests of the country they govern. These leaders are chosen through various processes, some examples of which would be through elections, in a democratic nation, and through lineage or birthright, in case of a monarchy, or even dictatorships wherein one individual declares herself/ himself the head of state. A look at the political leader&rsquo;s hall of fame would reveal names like Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, Winston Churchill.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina is one of the most famous names of Bangladesh&rsquo;s politics who is loved by the masses. This great leader has risen to the ranks of becoming the prime minister of her country and has been serving in this position for a period of fourteen years. Her life is an excellent example of leadership that inspires people throughout the world. It is time for her to drag Bangladesh and its people and leaders into a new nation that reinvents itself, rediscovers its lost moral values, and gingered into the new global order.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Mother of Humanity </p>

<p>The UK-based &lsquo;Channel 4 News&rsquo; in September 2017 first d&eacute;buted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina as the &lsquo;Mother of Humanity&rsquo; after her valiant resolution to open Bangladesh-Myanmar borders for the fleeing persecuted Rohingya people from Myanmar&rsquo;s Rakhine State. Following this, the daughter of the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Sheikh Hasina, has come to be known as the &lsquo;Mother of Humanity&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The persecution by the Myanmar security forces and local vigilantes on the Rohingya people in the Rakhine State has resulted in fleeing of over a million Rohingya people to Bangladesh. An estimated 738,805 Rohingya people arrived in Bangladesh within a few days since 25 August 2017 when the Myanmar military coordinated an operation, which the world came to term as a &ldquo;textbook example of ethnic cleansing&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has stated that &ldquo;if my government can arrange food for over one hundred sixty million people of Bangladesh, we would also be able to feed one million people more&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The persecution of the Rohingya people has generated a multi-dimensional and multi-layered crisis for Bangladesh ranging from economic, security, environmental, social, and political. The crisis has also severely impacted on Cox Bazar&rsquo;s ecosystem, wildlife habitat, labor market, access to public services, law and order situation, etc.&nbsp; Despite various challenges to the economy, ecology, and overall societal rubrics of Bangladesh, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina&rsquo;s decision to shelter the persecuted Rohingya people emanates from humanity alone.</p>

<p>The government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina believes that humanitarian responses would help the forcibly displaced Rohingya people only temporarily. A durable solution of the problem is a must for the sake of humanity. Bangladesh government has engaged diplomatically with Myanmar to make sure that the Rohingya people are enabled to exercise their right to return to their own homeland.</p>

<p>Likewise, the world seen even in some developed parts of the world the policy of closed borders and push back of refugees, had Bangladesh followed the same script that would have resulted in the death of thousands of persecuted Rohingya people. But Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina saved the lives of thousands of Rohingya people by opening borders and providing them shelter and other humanitarian assistance, out of only her humanitarian compassion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Honor, awards she was conferred </p>

<p>Her most recent role in extending humanitarian support to over 1.1 million forcibly displaced Rohingyas from Myanmar, who have taken shelter in Cox&rsquo;s Bazar, drew accolade from global leaders, institutions and eminent personalities.</p>

<p>Asiatic Society of Kolkata honored Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina with the prestigious &ldquo;Tagore Peace Award-2018&rdquo; in recognition of her contribution to maintaining regional peace and prosperity.</p>

<p>President of Kolkata Asiatic Society Professor Isha Mohammed handed over the award to Sheikh Hasina at a function at Taj Mahal Hotel in the Indian capital on October 5, 2019.</p>

<p>She also received the prestigious &lsquo;Vaccine Hero&rsquo; award given in recognition of Bangladesh&rsquo;s outstanding success in vaccination. Global Alliance for Vaccination and Immunizations (GAVI) handed over the award to the premier at a ceremony at the Conference Room of the UN Headquarters in New York during the 74th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2019.</p>

<p>The premier was conferred with the award &lsquo;Champion of Skill Development for Youth&rsquo; for Bangladesh&rsquo;s great success in youth skill development. The United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund (UNICEF) conferred the award on the premier at a ceremony at Labouisse Hall of UNICEF House in the UN Plaza on September 26 in 2019.</p>

<p>UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore handed over the award to the prime minister amid thunderous clappings of the audience.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina also received the Dr Kalam Smriti International Excellence Awards-2019, introduced in memory of eminent scientist and former Indian President Dr APJ Abdul Kalam.</p>

<p>The award was conferred upon Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in recognition of her commitment to a close and mutually satisfying India-Bangladesh relations, the welfare of her people, particularly women and children, and international peace and cooperation.</p>

<p>Chief Adviser of the Dr Kalam Smriti International Advisory Council Ambassador TP Sreenivasan handed over the accolade through a ceremony at the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office here on September 16, 2019.</p>

<p>She deserves the Nobel peace prize. The world&rsquo;s renowned thinkers and educators have proposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for the unique example of humanity and peace in the Rohingya issue. Sheikh Hasina was unanimously accepted the United Nations&rsquo; philosophy of &lsquo;people&rsquo;s empowerment&rsquo; philosophy of world peace.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina was also conferred with various honourary degrees, accolades, and awards in recognition of her leadership excellence and intellectual flair. These include: honorary Doctor of Laws by the Waseda University of Japan, honorary Doctorate of Philosophy in Liberal Arts by University of Abertay Dundee, UK, honorary Degree of Desikottama by Visva-Bharati University of West Bengal, India, honorary Doctor of Laws by the Australian National University, honorary Doctor of Humane Letters by the Bridgeport University, USA, honorary Doctor of Laws by the University of Dhaka, Paul Haris Fellowship by the Rotary International, UNESCO&rsquo;s Houphouet-Boigny Peace Prize in 1998, M K Gandhi Award in 1998, Mother Teresa Award in 1998 and 2006, Pearl S.

				<p>Sheikh Hasina&nbsp;the eldest child&nbsp;of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Founding Father of Bangladesh and the first president of Bangladesh, and Sheikh Fazilatunnesa Mujib was born at Tungipara in Gopalganj on September 28 in 1947. She has passed her whole child living in the village of&nbsp;Gopalganj.&nbsp;As she said in many interviews that she had grown up in fear due to her father&rsquo;s political works. During the peak of violence of the 1970 Elections in Pakistan as well as her father&rsquo;s arrest she had lived in refuge with her grandmother. She says, &ldquo;I was not allowed to go to the school. Because I had to cross the canal by a wooden bridge, she was very much afraid that if I fall from this wooden bridge I will fall in the river&rdquo;. She was active in the student politics of Dhaka University. Hasina was not in Bangladesh when her great father was assassinated barbarically on 15 August 1975. She was not allowed to return to the country until after she was elected to lead the Awami League on 16 February 1981 and returned to Bangladesh on 17 May 1981.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<figure><img></figure>

<p>&ldquo;If Rabi Thakur is the poet of</p>

<p>reflection and thoughts, if</p>

<p>Bangabandhu is the poet of politics,</p>

<p>then Sheikh Hasina is the poet of development.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Post liberation war politics and Sheikh Hasina</p>

<p>The Awami League has been described as a &ldquo;left-of-center&rdquo; political party. Hasina was in and out of detention throughout the 1980s. In 1984, Hasina was put under house arrest in February and again in November. In March 1985, she was put under house arrest for three months in the Ershad regime. Ershad dissolved the parliament in December 1987. During November and December that year, a mass political uprising took place in Dhaka demanding a fresh general election under a neutral caretaker government. Several people were killed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1st caretaker government</p>

<p>After several years of autocratic rule, widespread protests and strikes created so much unrest that the economy was not functioning. A huge mass protest in December 1990 ousted General Ershad from the power, who resigned in favor of selected Vice President Justice Shahabuddin. The caretaker government, headed by Shahabuddin Ahmed, the Chief Justice of the Bangladesh Supreme Court, administered a general election for the parliament. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) led by Khaleda Zia won a general majority, and Hasina&rsquo;s Awami League emerged as the largest opposition party. In 1996 elections, the Awami League, with other opposition parties, demanded that the next general elections be held under a neutral caretaker government, and that provision for caretaker governments to manage elections be incorporated in the constitution. The ruling BNP refused to act on these demands. Opposition parties launched an unprecedented campaign, calling strikes for weeks on end. The government accused them of destroying the economy while the opposition countered that BNP could solve this problem by acceding to their demands. In late 1995, the MPs of the Awami League and other parties resigned from the parliament. Parliament completed its term and a general election was held on 15 February 1996. The election was boycotted by all major parties except the ruling BNP. Hasina described the election as a farce.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2nd caretaker government</p>

<p>The new parliament, composed mostly of BNP members, amended the constitution to create provisions for a caretaker government (CTG). The next parliamentary elections on 30 June 1996 were held under a neutral caretaker government headed by retired chief Justice Muhammad Habibur Rahman. Sheikh Hasina served her first term as prime minister of Bangladesh from 1996-2001. She signed the 30 year water sharing treaty of the Ganges with India. Her administration repealed the Indemnity Act, which protected the killers of the country&rsquo;s Founding Father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Muijibur Rahman, her father and the first president of Bangladesh. Her government opened the telecom industry to the private sector which till then was limited to government-owned companies. In 1999 the government started the New Industrial Policy (NIP) which aimed to strengthen the private industry and encourage growth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3rd caretaker government</p>

<p>During her second term as leader of the opposition, political unrest and violence increased. Ahsanullah Master, an MP, was killed in 2004. This was followed by a grenade attack on 21 August on an Awami League gathering in Dhaka, resulting in the death of 21 party supporters, including party women&rsquo;s secretary Ivy Rahman. Shah M S Kibria, Hasina&rsquo;s former finance minister, was also killed that year, in a grenade attack in Sylhet that year. Caretaker government and military intervention happened in October 2006&ndash;2008. The months preceding the planned 22 January 2007 elections were filled with political unrest and controversy. Following the end of Khaleda Zia&rsquo;s government in late October 2006, there were protests and strikes, during which 40 people were killed in the following month, over uncertainty about who would head the caretaker government.</p>

<p>The caretaker government had difficulty bringing the all parties to the table. Awami League and its allies protested and alleged that the caretaker government favored the BNP. Later in the month, the president Tajuddin Ahmed imposed a state of emergency. Political activity was prohibited. Fakhruddin Ahmed became the chief advisor of the caretaker government. On 16 July 2007, Hasina was arrested by state police at her home and taken before a local court in Dhaka. She was accused of extortion and denied bail, and was held in a building converted into a jail on the premises of the National Parliament. The Awami League said the arrest was politically motivated. On 17 July 2007, the Anti-Corruption Commission sent notices to both Hasina and Khaleda Zia, instructing them to provide details of their assets to the Commission within one week.</p>

<p>On 30 July 2007, the Dhaka High Court suspended Hasina&rsquo;s extortion trial and ordered her release on bail. On 2 September 2007, an additional case was filed against Hasina by the Anti-Corruption Commission regarding the awarding of a contract for the construction of a power plant in 1997, for which she allegedly took a bribe of 30 million takas and kept the contract from going to the lowest bidder. Six others were also accused of involvement. A graft case was filed against Begum Zia on the same day. On 13 January 2008, Hasina was indicted on extortion charges by a special court along with two of her relatives, her sister Sheikh Rehana and her cousin Sheikh Selim. On 6 February, the High Court stopped the trial, ruling that she could not be prosecuted under emergency laws for crimes alleged to have been committed prior to the imposition of the state of emergency.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9th national parliamentary elections, 2008 and digital Bangladesh by 2021</p>

<p>On 11 June 2008, Hasina was released on parole for medical reasons. The next day she flew to the United States to be treated for hearing impairment, eye problems and high blood pressure. On 6 November 2008, Hasina returned to Bangladesh to attend the Ninth National Parliamentary Elections 2008 scheduled for 29 December 2008 and decided to participate in the parliamentary election under the name of &ldquo;Grand Alliance&rdquo; comprising 14 political parties. On 11 December 2008, Hasina formally announced her party&rsquo;s election manifesto during a news conference and vowed to build a &ldquo;Digital Bangladesh&rdquo; by 2021. Her Bangladesh Awami League and its Grand Alliance won the general election held on 29 December 2008 with a two-thirds majority, numerically the party controls 230 seats out of 299.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>10th Parliamentary election in 2014</p>

<p>Throughout most of 2013, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its alliance of 18 opposition parties led by BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia called more than 85 days of nationwide general strikes and blockades that brought the entire country to a grinding halt. Despite thousands of objections and demands by the opposition parties aiming to throw the state in a vacuum of politics, the Sheikh Hasina&#39;s expertise in politics and leadership save the country as well as countrymen from a crisis of sovereignty. Since the ninth parliament&#39;s mandate expires on 24 January 2014, according to the constitution of Bangladesh&#39;s Article 123(2)(a) requires a general election to be held between the dates of 26 October 2013 and 24 January 2014 or rather within 90 days before the expiration of the Parliament.[9] On 25 November 2013, the Bangladesh Election Commission announced that the 10th general election would be held on 5 January 2014. But all the opposition except Ershad led Jatiya Party, boycotted the election. As a result of the boycott, the then incumbent Bangladesh Awami League won the election with a safe majority, winning 234 seats.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>11th Parliamentary Election</p>

<p>The 11th parliamentary of Bangladesh Jatiya Sangsad was held on 30th December 2019. From the lesson of boycotting the previous election in 2014, the opposition BNP took the earlier decision to participate in the 11th election. Due to the constitutional obligation, the election commission, one of the independent agencies of the state, organized the election in the scheduled time. In the election, the people of Bangladesh expressed their comprehensive support to the Awami League, the party of Liberation war through the franchise. Under the tactical leadership of Shaikh Hasina, Awami League won the election in a huge margin of 258 seats out of 300.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina&rsquo;s masterful politics</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina can work which rings around all of us who consider themselves as politicians. In her work is so stark one can smell the effluvia of the salted herring, breathe in the clean, cool sea air, and sink into the homey chairs at the local inns. One can also feel her emotional pain. She not only changes lives, she changes history. She belongs to those women who, by refusing to play by the rules that society handed to them, forever have altered the course of history. Hers is a women&rsquo;s history, sure, but it is also a critical piece of Bangladesh&rsquo;s History. Her story demonstrates how women in history are overlooked. Her gift to humanity has to be recognized to honor her work. Imagine being so famous and important she has an era be named after her name. You would either have to be incredibly lucky or really good. Hasina is probably both. She has created the persona of Sheikh Hasina, a woman who says little and makes few strong alliances. She is masterful at keeping her enemies at bay.</p>

<p>These discussions are relevant today. A significant amount of historical narrative is still being written by those with the most power. If you walk into any of the world&rsquo;s most powerful institutions (government, academic or corporate) you will also identify that the group that are shaping history are Bangladesh&rsquo;s women. No woman is known in the history of Bangladesh&rsquo;s reactions and responses to the foreign power better than Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>She not only changes lives, she changes history. She belongs to those women who, by refusing to play by the rules that society handed to them, forever have altered the course of history.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina is like a rock</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina is like a rock. If you strike a woman, you strike a rock. She is not a woman but a world. A strong, visionary, spirited woman whose transcendental life, or whose legendary stories, have elevated mankind with their mystique, incomparable ethereal beauty, wisdom, wit, virtue, grace, talent, kindness or exceptional courage. Start your &ldquo;Extraordinary Heroines&rdquo; genealogical journey, experience past worlds, stroll through the annals of world history to meet the remarkable ancestors upon whose stalwart shoulders we stand today. She personifies outstanding attributes of her times to help you capture the spirit of the times, and the mood of the moment. We will encounter the influence and persuasiveness of her power through the ages. Be awed by the transcendental qualities of the breathtaking, bold, brave women of the sacred Scriptures, and the powerful women icons of ancient, classical and civilizations. Admire the zealous, valiant, spirited, pioneering, wise women of the middle ages who paved the way for the passionate, creative, revolutionary, luminary Renaissance Thinkers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her ideas and experience are interesting and valuable</p>

<p>When you are sitting with her ... she makes you feel like your ideas and your experience are interesting and valuable. She emboldens lots of young women who are often at the bottom of the totem poll ... to feel confident enough about themselves that they have gone on to be on television or to change governments. She has made general people feel happy and cheerful.</p>

<p>She is a very courageous woman&hellip;She is a politician the country has ever produced! She is loyal to her country and knows exactly what it stands for. To me, a hero or a heroine is someone who is respected and does not care what others think. A hero or a heroine is someone who has done things that have made a difference, thinks for themselves, and of course, has a sense of style. The one person who matches every one of these traits is a Bengali of Bangladesh. However, this is not what she has to be remembered for. Sheikh Hasina has to be remembered for being herself. She represents her strong-mindedness and her wise decision-making ability.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her flawless political endeavors</p>

<p>She has been throwing and catching several objects simultaneously in her political pursuits with her political roles and activism and intertwining all her various endeavors flawlessly. Gender disparities still exist. Such disparities undermine not only women&rsquo;s capacity to participate in and benefit from development, but also the effectiveness of development as a whole. This is the reason for the PM Hasina&rsquo;s insistence that illiteracy must be eliminated within a short period of time. She also feels that the general public still doesn&rsquo;t view women as fully credible within the political spectrum. She has been trying to implement programs promoting the contributions and capacities of women to help sway the general public away from archaic male-biased ideologies. In everything she does, Hasina is devoted to promoting the advancement of women. She uses her various political pursuits, her political prominence, her Bangladesh&rsquo;s and international connections, as well as her passionate grass-roots approach -- towards supporting female empowerment in public policies, education, science, technology, public service, culture, and within society as a whole.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A woman who does not hand out aid</p>

<p>She is a woman who does not hand out aid. She has been creating innovative new ways for women &ndash; and men &ndash; to lift themselves out of poverty. What is a hero? Webster&rsquo;s Collegiate Dictionary defines a hero as, &ldquo;A Myth. Legend. A man (or woman) of great strength or courage&hellip;&rdquo; Whom do you think of? Some might think of Superman or Gandalf. Others would say firefighters or policemen - anyone who risks their life to save someone else. My definition of a hero is someone who, even in the face of opposition, perseveres in the job people have laid out for them, continuing to trust in them. One of the people I most admire is Sheikh Hasina. Throughout all her life, she has done things for other people and not for herself. When I hear the word &ldquo;hero&rdquo; I instantly think of the three H&rsquo;s: someone who is honorable, hardworking, and happy. When I think more about this word I picture someone who has accomplished good things for people and tries to do the right thing. Hasina is one person whom I find to be very heroic.</p>

<p>She seems proper and serious, even stern at times, but inside her, there seems to be a completely different person; a caring lady who is interested in other people&rsquo;s lives.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina believes in the future welfare of Bangladesh</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina believes that the future welfare of Bangladesh is in great part also dependent on the economic development and success of its citizens, and likewise, they are also working to improve economic conditions for the less fortunate. Her works have not gone unnoticed by the world either. In fact, she has received a number of awards and commendations for her works. She merges the roles of wife, mother, philanthropist, activist, and of course, she, seamlessly, with all facets of her life given equal dedication. As a crusader for the rights of women and children, an advocate of advancements in education, technology, and healthcare, a promoter of entrepreneurship and microfinance, and a forerunner in the battle to eradicate poverty and to bridge educational and other divides, it is clear why so many consider Sheikh Hasina to be a role model, not only for people in the South Asia, but for people everywhere. She is incredibly passionate about her work, which is what I think inspires many people to get involved and support her work.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s clear the people who go through her work love her, too &ndash; they flock to her like a den mother! She is a great woman, who will forever be remembered for helping others. When someone thinks of a hero they usually think of someone who wears a mask, a cape or has superpowers, but I think a hero is someone who pushes you to be the best you can be, or to do what you want to do without caring about who you are, what you do, or how old you are.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her motivation and direction to achieve larger goals</p>

<p>Whether they led a country, history&rsquo;s best leaders understood the importance of providing the motivation and direction to achieve larger goals. Poor leaders lose the faith and trust of the people they lead, while great leaders seem to lead without effort. The character, actions and thoughts of a leader, good or bad, permeate an organization. Your goal should be to demonstrate the best qualities of a leader while encouraging the same from those who follow you. A political leader, or a politician, can be anyone who has taken up the responsibility of governing a tribe, city, state, region or even an entire nation. History has given us a plethora of political leaders, both good and bad, who have dedicated their lives to the betterment of their countries and the people living in the country. Political leaders are not just people who govern nations during peace times but also during times of crisis.</p>

<p>They are people who are responsible for making and implementing strategies and policies meant to better serve the interests of the country they govern. These leaders are chosen through various processes, some examples of which would be through elections, in a democratic nation, and through lineage or birthright, in case of a monarchy, or even dictatorships wherein one individual declares herself/ himself the head of state. A look at the political leader&rsquo;s hall of fame would reveal names like Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, Winston Churchill.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina is one of the most famous names of Bangladesh&rsquo;s politics who is loved by the masses. This great leader has risen to the ranks of becoming the prime minister of her country and has been serving in this position for a period of fourteen years. Her life is an excellent example of leadership that inspires people throughout the world. It is time for her to drag Bangladesh and its people and leaders into a new nation that reinvents itself, rediscovers its lost moral values, and gingered into the new global order.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Mother of Humanity </p>

<p>The UK-based &lsquo;Channel 4 News&rsquo; in September 2017 first d&eacute;buted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina as the &lsquo;Mother of Humanity&rsquo; after her valiant resolution to open Bangladesh-Myanmar borders for the fleeing persecuted Rohingya people from Myanmar&rsquo;s Rakhine State. Following this, the daughter of the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Sheikh Hasina, has come to be known as the &lsquo;Mother of Humanity&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The persecution by the Myanmar security forces and local vigilantes on the Rohingya people in the Rakhine State has resulted in fleeing of over a million Rohingya people to Bangladesh. An estimated 738,805 Rohingya people arrived in Bangladesh within a few days since 25 August 2017 when the Myanmar military coordinated an operation, which the world came to term as a &ldquo;textbook example of ethnic cleansing&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has stated that &ldquo;if my government can arrange food for over one hundred sixty million people of Bangladesh, we would also be able to feed one million people more&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The persecution of the Rohingya people has generated a multi-dimensional and multi-layered crisis for Bangladesh ranging from economic, security, environmental, social, and political. The crisis has also severely impacted on Cox Bazar&rsquo;s ecosystem, wildlife habitat, labor market, access to public services, law and order situation, etc.&nbsp; Despite various challenges to the economy, ecology, and overall societal rubrics of Bangladesh, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina&rsquo;s decision to shelter the persecuted Rohingya people emanates from humanity alone.</p>

<p>The government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina believes that humanitarian responses would help the forcibly displaced Rohingya people only temporarily. A durable solution of the problem is a must for the sake of humanity. Bangladesh government has engaged diplomatically with Myanmar to make sure that the Rohingya people are enabled to exercise their right to return to their own homeland.</p>

<p>Likewise, the world seen even in some developed parts of the world the policy of closed borders and push back of refugees, had Bangladesh followed the same script that would have resulted in the death of thousands of persecuted Rohingya people. But Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina saved the lives of thousands of Rohingya people by opening borders and providing them shelter and other humanitarian assistance, out of only her humanitarian compassion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Honor, awards she was conferred </p>

<p>Her most recent role in extending humanitarian support to over 1.1 million forcibly displaced Rohingyas from Myanmar, who have taken shelter in Cox&rsquo;s Bazar, drew accolade from global leaders, institutions and eminent personalities.</p>

<p>Asiatic Society of Kolkata honored Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina with the prestigious &ldquo;Tagore Peace Award-2018&rdquo; in recognition of her contribution to maintaining regional peace and prosperity.</p>

<p>President of Kolkata Asiatic Society Professor Isha Mohammed handed over the award to Sheikh Hasina at a function at Taj Mahal Hotel in the Indian capital on October 5, 2019.</p>

<p>She also received the prestigious &lsquo;Vaccine Hero&rsquo; award given in recognition of Bangladesh&rsquo;s outstanding success in vaccination. Global Alliance for Vaccination and Immunizations (GAVI) handed over the award to the premier at a ceremony at the Conference Room of the UN Headquarters in New York during the 74th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2019.</p>

<p>The premier was conferred with the award &lsquo;Champion of Skill Development for Youth&rsquo; for Bangladesh&rsquo;s great success in youth skill development. The United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund (UNICEF) conferred the award on the premier at a ceremony at Labouisse Hall of UNICEF House in the UN Plaza on September 26 in 2019.</p>

<p>UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore handed over the award to the prime minister amid thunderous clappings of the audience.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina also received the Dr Kalam Smriti International Excellence Awards-2019, introduced in memory of eminent scientist and former Indian President Dr APJ Abdul Kalam.</p>

<p>The award was conferred upon Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in recognition of her commitment to a close and mutually satisfying India-Bangladesh relations, the welfare of her people, particularly women and children, and international peace and cooperation.</p>

<p>Chief Adviser of the Dr Kalam Smriti International Advisory Council Ambassador TP Sreenivasan handed over the accolade through a ceremony at the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office here on September 16, 2019.</p>

<p>She deserves the Nobel peace prize. The world&rsquo;s renowned thinkers and educators have proposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for the unique example of humanity and peace in the Rohingya issue. Sheikh Hasina was unanimously accepted the United Nations&rsquo; philosophy of &lsquo;people&rsquo;s empowerment&rsquo; philosophy of world peace.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina was also conferred with various honourary degrees, accolades, and awards in recognition of her leadership excellence and intellectual flair. These include: honorary Doctor of Laws by the Waseda University of Japan, honorary Doctorate of Philosophy in Liberal Arts by University of Abertay Dundee, UK, honorary Degree of Desikottama by Visva-Bharati University of West Bengal, India, honorary Doctor of Laws by the Australian National University, honorary Doctor of Humane Letters by the Bridgeport University, USA, honorary Doctor of Laws by the University of Dhaka, Paul Haris Fellowship by the Rotary International, UNESCO&rsquo;s Houphouet-Boigny Peace Prize in 1998, M K Gandhi Award in 1998, Mother Teresa Award in 1998 and 2006, Pearl S.

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">Today is September 28, the 74th birthday of Prime Minister and Bangladesh Awami League President Sheikh Hasina, the eldest of the five children of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Begum Fazilatunnesa.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina, was born at Tungipara in Gopalganj on September 28 in 1947.</p>

<p>Like previous years, Awami League and its affiliated organizations are celebrating the day through various programs highlighting the life and achievements of Sheikh Hasina, who is driving the nation towards prosperity following the footsteps of her father Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.</p>

<p>On the occasion, discussions, milad and doa mahfils, special prayers and photo exhibitions have been arranged in the capital and different parts of the country, abiding by the appropriate health rules.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina spent much of her childhood in the small hamlet where she was born. She started her schooling there. When Bangabandhu was elected a legislator, his family shifted to Dhaka in 1954.</p>

<p>She was enrolled to what is now Sher-e-Bangla Girls&rsquo; School and College and later to Azimpur Girls&rsquo; High School from where she completed her secondary education in 1965. She was then admitted to Badrunnessa Government Girls&rsquo; College.</p>

<p>During her bachelor course, she was elected as the vice-president of the students&rsquo; union of Eden Girls&rsquo; College (That time, Badrunnessa and Eden Girls&rsquo; College was a single entity). Later, she enrolled into her Masters&rsquo; program at the Bengali Department of Dhaka University.</p>

<p>As a student leader, Sheikh Hasina actively took part in the six-point movement of 1966 and the student movement of 1969 which saw the abdication of General Ayub Khan.</p>

<p>In 1968, with the blessings of her imprisoned father, Sheikh Hasina who is leading the country as the prime minister for the third consecutive term got married to nuclear scientist Dr Wazed Miah.</p>

<p>During the Liberation War, Sheikh Hasina and her family were interned in a house in Dhaka. On July 27 in 1971, her first child Sajib Wazed Joy was born. Her second child Saima Wazed Hossain was born on December 9, 1972.</p>

<p>After the assassination of her parents in 1975, Sheikh Hasina and her family were offered political asylum in India, where she stayed till 1981 when she was elected as the president of the Awami League in her absence.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina returned home on May 17, 1981 when she was greeted by a mammoth crowd that extended from the Airport to Farm Gate and Manik Miah Avenue and she addressed a public rally.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina returned home on May 17, 1981 when she was greeted by a mammoth crowd that extended from the Airport to Farm Gate and Manik Miah Avenue and she addressed a public rally.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the 1986 parliamentary election, Sheikh Hasina was elected as parliament member from three different constituencies. After the overthrow of autocracy in 1990, she was elected as the Leader of the Opposition in the House.</p>

<p>In 1996, 21 years after her father was assassinated, Sheikh Hasina led the Awami League and helped the party assume power and became the prime minister for the first time.</p>

<p>On August 21, 2004, Sheikh Hasina, the then opposition leader, barely escaped an attempt on her life as grenades were lobbed at an AL rally on Bangabandhu Avenue in the capital. Although she survived the attack, at least 24 people were killed and over 200 others injured. Most of them were Awami League leaders and supporters.</p>

<p>In 2008, she led the Grand Alliance to an overwhelming victory acquiring 90 percent of parliament seats in the general elections. She was elected the prime minister on January 5, 2014 for the second time in a row.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina assumed the office of the Prime Minister for a third consecutive term with a thumping victory in general elections in December 2018.</p>

<p>Under her leadership, Bangladesh has become a role model for development, attaining steady economic growth, becoming self-sufficient in food and attaining a marked progress in the fields of women empowerment, agriculture, education, health, infrastructure, communication, energy and power, trade and commerce, ICT and the SME sectors.</p>

<p>Her most recent role in extending humanitarian support to over 1.1 million forcibly displaced Rohingyas from Myanmar, who have taken shelter in Cox&rsquo;s Bazar, drew accolade from global leaders, institutions and eminent personalities.</p></description>

<p>Sheikh Hasina spent much of her childhood in the small hamlet where she was born. She started her schooling there. When Bangabandhu was elected a legislator, his family shifted to Dhaka in 1954.</p>

<p>She was enrolled to what is now Sher-e-Bangla Girls&rsquo; School and College and later to Azimpur Girls&rsquo; High School from where she completed her secondary education in 1965. She was then admitted to Badrunnessa Government Girls&rsquo; College.</p>

<p>During her bachelor course, she was elected as the vice-president of the students&rsquo; union of Eden Girls&rsquo; College (That time, Badrunnessa and Eden Girls&rsquo; College was a single entity). Later, she enrolled into her Masters&rsquo; program at the Bengali Department of Dhaka University.</p>

<p>As a student leader, Sheikh Hasina actively took part in the six-point movement of 1966 and the student movement of 1969 which saw the abdication of General Ayub Khan.</p>

<p>In 1968, with the blessings of her imprisoned father, Sheikh Hasina who is leading the country as the prime minister for the third consecutive term got married to nuclear scientist Dr Wazed Miah.
During the Liberation War, Sheikh Hasina and her family were interned in a house in Dhaka. On July 27 in 1971, her first child Sajib Wazed Joy was born. Her second child Saima Wazed Hossain was born on December 9, 1972.</p>

<p>After the assassination of her parents in 1975, Sheikh Hasina and her family were offered political asylum in India, where she stayed till 1981 when she was elected as the president of the Awami League in her absence.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina returned home on May 17, 1981 when she was greeted by a mammoth crowd that extended from the Airport to Farm Gate and Manik Miah Avenue and she addressed a public rally.

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">The government has allowed to take &lsquo;O&rsquo; and &lsquo;A&rsquo; level exams in October and November for the English medium students conditionally.</p>

<p>The Department of Secondary and Higher Education of the Ministry of Education has recently sent a letter of approval to the Council&#39;s Country Director following a request from the British Council.</p>

<p>The British Council had on September 6 applied to the Ministry of Education to take &#39;O&#39; and &#39;A&#39; level examinations.</p>

<p>Following the approval, the British Council said in a press release on Sunday that the GCSE, IGCSE, &#39;O&#39; Level and International &#39;A&#39; Level examinations for October-November 2020 would be taken up on pre-announced schedule.</p>

<p>The May-June exams for English medium students were canceled worldwide due to the coronavirus epidemic.</p>

<p>It said the Ministry of Education had agreed to conduct &#39;O&#39; and &#39;A&#39; level examinations from October 1 to November 23 under the auspices of the British Council.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education has said that a maximum of 1,800 candidates can be tested every day at 35 venues across the country and each student has to sit at a distance of at least six feet.
The letter said the government could revoke the permission to take the test in the &quot;public interest&quot; at any time considering the situation.</p>

<p>&quot;If a candidate is infected with coronavirus during the test, the British Council will have to bear the responsibility,&quot; it said.</p>

<p>According to the British Council, about 5,200 students registered in July-August to take part in their October-November exams. The UK Exam Board will evaluate the candidates on the basis of the test only, without qualification related to art and design in this test.</p></description>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">About 15,000 hectares of cropland have gone underwater in nine upazilas of Kurigram during the fifth phase flooding triggered by onrush of upstream water and heavy downpours.</p>

<p>The amount of damage incurred by farmers was not immediately clear.</p>

<p>A large-scale destruction of crops could potentially cause a shortage in the local market and trigger price hike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damage to crops could increase further,&rdquo; said Shamsuddin Mia, the acting deputy director of Kurigram Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE).</p>

<p>He said it would take them about a week to estimate the loss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A total of 15,000 hectares of cropland containing Ropa Aman, peanuts, vegetables, among others, went underwater in the district,&rdquo; Mia said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, road communication has been snapped in many parts of Kurigram.</p>

<p>A number of char areas including Kurigram Sadar upazila, Rajarhat upazila, Phulbari upazila and Ulipur upazilas were flooded, marooning 60,000 people.</p>

<p>In some places, people took shelter on high roads and embankment with their livestock.\</p>

<p>Besides, a number of houses were washed away by the strong current of Dharla River while erosion took a serious turn in many areas, putting houses, educational institutions, roads and flood protection dam at risk.</p>

<p>Moinuddin Bhola, a UP member of Jatrapur Union in Sadar upazila, said the authorities did not take any action even after the river gobbled up at least 10 houses in Garuhara village.</p>

<p>Kurigram Water Development Board Executive Engineer Ariful Islam said Dharla was flowing 28cm above its danger level in the morning. Sixteen rivers in the district are flowing beneath the danger mark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Erosion took a serious turn at 20 points of Brahmaputra, Dharla, Dudhkumar and Teesta rivers and the work to protect the riverbanks is underway,&rdquo; said Islam.</p>

<p>Flood showed no sign of improvement in the last couple of days. Kurigram District Relief and Rehabilitation office said 12MT rice and 2,000 packets of dry food were distributed among the flood-hit people.</p></description>

<p>To celebrate its 22nd birthday, Google has created a special doodle.</p>

<p>The doodle features the logo &lsquo;G&rsquo; sitting in front of a laptop doing a video call. The birthday celebration video call is with the rest of the letters - OOGLE. There&rsquo;s also a piece of cake and presents in the Google Doodle.

<p>The doodle features the logo &lsquo;G&rsquo; sitting in front of a laptop doing a video call. The birthday celebration video call is with the rest of the letters - OOGLE.

		<description><p>That was in mid-July of 2002 when char dweller Safaruddin&rsquo;s wife Saleha Khatun died from antenatal complication for absence of any healthcare facility at where they live, a small isle on the intersection of two major rives &ndash; Brahmaputra and Teesta &ndash; in the north-eastern part of Bangladesh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That time our nearest health facility was the health complex in Chilmari upazila sadar and you need a sailing boat to get there &hellip; Yes .. no doubt!! I managed a boat with my level best try and scrambled to sadar with my ailing wife &hellip; but no &hellip; I couldn&rsquo;t make it &hellip; she died at the boat,&rdquo; Safaruddin recalled the most tragic moment of his life in chocked voice.</p>

<p>This is just one out of a thousand incidents that the marginal people of the char area used to go through especially in emergency cases during the child birth. But the scenario has changed now. Currently, the river-erosion-hit distressed marginal char inhabitants got their healthcare savior &ndash; &lsquo;community clinic&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, when I see pregnant women are going to the community clinic at our char and getting free treatment and medicine from there, I felt sorry for my late wife .. if this clinic would have been here in 2002, I may not lose my spouse and my kids would not be orphans,&rdquo; said Safaruddin with a remorse voice.</p>

<p>Rahmatullah, a retired school teacher at Chilmari Upazila said poor people of chars are actually ignorant of the fact that health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being and accessible health system is essential to fulfill this right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, now when they are getting health care at free of cost it seems like a dream to them &hellip; thanks the present government to do something for this underprivileged people,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The story of Ashia, a mid-aged widow of Kodalkati char under Chilmari Upazila, is kind of similar as she had lost her husband due to lack of treatment 15 years back.</p>

<p>After being a widow, she had even lost half of her ancestral land in river erosion which pushed her further in the struggle of life with three kids. &ldquo;I have passed many days with fever without any medicine as we don&rsquo;t have enough money to buy medicine,&rdquo; Ashia said in a pale voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I lost hope of life. But, suddenly the community clinic changed the scenario. Now, I can visit doctors there anytime and the privileged thing is that we get medicine at free of cost,&rdquo; she said with a sigh of relief that also flashed out in her eyes.</p>

<p>Other char women also echoed Ashia and said currently they are getting maternal healthcare along with other services at the community clinic. &ldquo;Now women of our char are getting skilled birth attendants during the delivery,&rdquo; Sakhina, a 40-year-old woman residing at the same char said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are too poor to see private physicians. We don&rsquo;t have enough money to go to Sadar upazila by boat to visit a doctor even at the public hospital there. Thanks to the community clinics which come to us as saviours,&rdquo; said Rafiqul Islam, a 60-year old man residing at the char.</p>

<p>He said the community clinic took just a few days to become popular. &ldquo;Every day, people are taking health care services standing in queues. We are too happy to get healthcare services at our doorsteps&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Civil Surgeon of Kurigram district Dr M Habibur Rahman said currently community clinics all over the district becoming the prime source of primary healthcare for people specially the poor. &ldquo;The clinics remain open for six days in a week providing treatment to 50 to 60 patients daily,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The clinics are providing services like mother and children healthcare, reproductive healthcare, family planning, vaccination, nutrition, diabetics, high blood pressure and 30 kinds of primary medicines at free of cost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The clinics are playing important roles in ensuring healthcare services at char level. The confidence level and reliability of people are getting higher day by day regarding the services of the clinics,&rdquo; Dr Rahman said.</p>

<p>Terming the community clinic as one of the most successful innovative initiatives of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, he said, &ldquo;Initially there was a mixed perception of the common people regarding the service of community clinics. But right now, the sincerity of the clinic staffs has helped the people gain confidence in it,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Community Health Care Providers (CHCP) at char areas said they have been frequently conducting safe normal deliveries at the center.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apart from reproductive healthcare we are providing treatment to children over primary diseases like flu, fever and stomachache &hellip; we are receiving 60 to 70 patients every day,&rdquo; said Shahjahan Miah, a local CHCP.</p>

<p>The CHCPs of the community clinic located at different char areas have been passing busiest time compared to other clinics in the Kurigram district due to their remoteness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are attending more patients compared to other centers as char people mostly fishermen and their family members don&rsquo;t have another better choice rather than coming here for getting healthcare,&rdquo; said one of the CHCPs of the char area.</p>

<p>Community Clinic is the flagship program of Awami League government, an innovation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to extend primary health care to the doorsteps of people all over rural Bangladesh.</p>

<p>There are nearly 18000 community clinics currently in the country and the number is gradually increasing.</p></description>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">Speakers at a webinar in the capital&nbsp;have said that Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman&rsquo;s worthy daughter Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has struggled a lot to strengthen the Awami League so that the party can stand on its own feet to do welfare of the people of Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Despite the threat to her own death after losing family members, Awami League (AL) President and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has been working along with her party with utmost sincerity for a long time for the betterment of the people in the country without thinking of herself, they said in a special webinar ahead of her 74th birthday.</p>

<p>The Centre for Research and Information (CRI), a research institute of Bangladesh Awami League, organized the webinar on the occasion of Sheikh Hasina&rsquo;s 74th birthday last night (Saturday).</p>

<p>AL Presidium Member Begum Matia Chowdhury, AL Joint General Secretary and Education Minister Dr Dipu Moni, former Dhaka University Vice-Chancellor Prof Dr AAMS Arefin Siddique, Freedom fighter and senior journalist Ajay Dasgupta and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Department of Ophthalmology&rsquo;s Associate Professor Dr Nuzhat Choudhury took part in it as discussants.</p>

<p>Former student leader and journalist Subhash Singha Roy conducted the webinar.</p>

<p>The day Sheikh Hasina returned to this country in 1981 was a tumultuous day, AL Presidium Member Begum Matia Chowdhury said, adding that the people of the country welcomed her that day as she was standing alone without most of her family members.</p>

<p>But, despite having all difficulties, she has ensured democracy for the people of this country and at the same time established the rule of law, she added.</p>

<p>The premier has turned the country into a digital Bangladesh, she said.</p>

<p>Senior journalist Ajay Dasgupta said that Bangabandhu&rsquo;s daughter had organized the Awami League from outside the country.</p>

<p>After 1981, she came to her homeland and bolstered the Awami League and motivated the party leaders and workers all the time, he added.</p>

<p>Education Minister Dr Dipu Moni said Sheikh Hasina has been watching the life of struggles from her family.</p>

<p>Her parents choose the path of struggle as they had a deep love for the people of the country, she said, adding that the same feelings have passed to her (Sheikh Hasina).</p>

<p>Despite all the fears, Sheikh Hasina did not think about her own destiny but about the people of the country, she added.</p>

<p>Former Dhaka University Vice-Chancellor Prof Dr AAMS Arefin Siddique said the humanitarian leader Sheikh Hasina is moving forward for the development of the country and she will lead the people of the country to the &lsquo;Sonar Bangla&rsquo; as dreamt by Bangabandhu.</p>

<p>Terming Sheikh Hasina as an undisputed leader, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Department of Ophthalmology&rsquo;s Associate Professor Dr Nuzhat Choudhury said she has brought war criminals to justice to free the nation from stigma.</p></description>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">Asthma does not appear to increase the risk for a person contracting COVID-19 or influence its severity, according to a team of Rutgers researchers.</p>

<p>&quot;Older age and conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes and obesity are reported risk factors for the development and progression of COVID-19,&quot; said Reynold A. Panettieri Jr., a pulmonary critical care physician and director of the Rutgers Institute for Translational Medicine and Science and co-author of a paper published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. &quot;However, people with asthma -- even those with diminished lung function who are being treated to manage asthmatic inflammation -- seem to be no worse affected by SARS-CoV-2 than a non-asthmatic person. There is limited data as to why this is the case -- if it is physiological or a result of the treatment to manage the inflammation.&quot;</p>

<p>Panettieri discusses what we know about asthma and inflammation and the important questions that still need to be answered.</p>

<p>Since the news has focused our attention on the effects of COVID-19 on people in vulnerable populations, those with asthma may become hyper-vigilant about personal hygiene and social distancing. Social distancing could improve asthma control since people who are self-quarantined are also not as exposed to seasonal triggers that include allergens or respiratory viruses. There is also evidence that people are being more attentive to taking their asthma medication during the pandemic, which can contribute to overall health.</p>

<p>Inhaled corticosteroids, which are commonly used to protect against asthma attacks, also may reduce the virus&#39; ability to establish an infection. However, studies have shown that steroids may decrease the body&#39;s immune response and worsen the inflammatory response. Steroids also have been shown to delay the clearing of the SARS and MERS virus -- similar to SARS-CoV-2 -- from the respiratory tract and thus may worsen COVID-19 outcomes. Future studies should address whether inhaled steroids in patients with asthma or allergies increase or decrease the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and whether these effects are different depending on the steroid type.</p>

<p>A person&#39;s susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 infection increases with age. However, since asthma sufferers tend to be younger than those with reported high-risk conditions, age-adjusted studies could help us better understand if age is a factor in explaining why asthma patients may not be at greater risk for infection.</p>

<p>Children and young adults with asthma suffer mainly from allergic inflammation, while older adults who experience the same type of airway inflammation can also suffer from eosinophilic asthma -- a more severe form. In these cases, people experience abnormally high levels of a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infection, which can cause inflammation in the airways, sinuses, nasal passages and lower respiratory tract, potentially making them more at risk for a serious case of COVID-19.</p>

<p>In addition, an enzyme attached to the cell membranes in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines that has been shown to be an entry point for SARS-CoV-2 into cells is increased in response to the virus. This enzyme is also thought to be beneficial in clearing other respiratory viruses, especially in children. How this enzyme affects the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect people with asthma is still unclear.</p>

<p>Asthma tends to be associated with far fewer other conditions than chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cardiovascular disease. If SARS-CoV-2 is a disease that causes dysfunction in the cells that line blood vessels throughout the body, then diabetes, heart disease, obesity and other diseases associated with this condition may make people more susceptible to the virus than those who are asthmatic. However, older people with asthma who also have high blood pressure, diabetes or heart disease may have similar instances of COVID-19 as non-asthmatics with those conditions.</p></description>

		<description><p>Data from NASA instruments aboard the ESA (European Space Agency) Rosetta mission have helped reveal that comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko has its own far-ultraviolet aurora. It is the first time such electromagnetic emissions in the far-ultraviolet have been documented on a celestial object other than a planet or moon. A paper on the findings was released today in the journal Nature Astronomy.</p>

<p>On Earth, aurora (also known as the northern or southern lights) are generated when electrically charged particles speeding from the Sun hit the upper atmosphere to create colorful shimmers of green, white, and red. Elsewhere in the solar system, Jupiter and some of its moons -- as well as Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and even Mars -- have all exhibited their own version of northern lights. But the phenomena had yet to be documented in comets.</p>

<p>Rosetta is space exploration&#39;s most traveled and accomplished comet hunter. Launched in 2004, it orbited comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P/C-G) from Aug. 2014 until its dramatic end-of-mission comet landing in Sept. 2016. The data for this most recent study is on what mission scientists initially interpreted as &quot;dayglow,&quot; a process caused by photons of light interacting with the envelope of gas -- known as the coma -- that radiates from, and surrounds, the comet&#39;s nucleus. But new analysis of the data paints a very different picture.</p>

<p>&quot;The glow surrounding 67P/C-G is one of a kind,&quot; said Marina Galand of Imperial College London and lead author of the study. &quot;By linking data from numerous Rosetta instruments, we were able to get a better picture of what was going on. This enabled us to unambiguously identify how 67P/C-G&#39;s ultraviolet atomic emissions form.&quot;</p>

<p>The data indicate 67P/C-G&#39;s emissions are actually auroral in nature. Electrons streaming out in the solar wind -- the stream of charged particles flowing out from the Sun -- interact with the gas in the comet&#39;s coma, breaking apart water and other molecules. The resulting atoms give off a distinctive far-ultraviolet light. Invisible to the naked eye, far-ultraviolet has the shortest wavelengths of radiation in the ultraviolet spectrum.</p>

<p>Exploring the emission of 67P/C-G will enable scientists to learn how the particles in the solar wind change over time, something that is crucial for understanding space weather throughout the solar system. By providing better information on how the Sun&#39;s radiation affects the space environment they must travel through, such information could ultimately can help protect satellites and spacecraft, as well as astronauts traveling to the Moon and Mars.</p>

<p>&quot;Rosetta is the gift that keeps on giving,&quot; said Paul Feldman, an investigator on Alice at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and a co-author of the paper. &quot;The treasure trove of data it returned over its two-year visit to the comet have allowed us to rewrite the book on these most exotic inhabitants of our solar system -- and by all accounts there is much more to come.&quot;</p>

<p>NASA-supplied instruments contributed to this investigation. The Ion and Electron Sensor (IES) instrument detected the amount and energy of electrons near the spacecraft, the Alice instrument measured the ultraviolet light emitted by the aurora, and the Microwave Instrument for the Rosetta Orbiter (MIRO) measured the amount of water molecules around the comet (the MIRO instrument includes contributions from France, Germany, and Taiwan). Other instruments aboard the spacecraft used in the research were the Italian Space Agency&#39;s Visible and InfraRed Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS), the Langmuir Probe (LAP) provided by Sweden, and the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA) provided by Switzerland.</p>

<p>Rosetta was an ESA mission with contributions from its member states and NASA. Rosetta&#39;s Philae lander, which successfully landed on the comet in November 2014, was provided by a consortium led by the German Aerospace Center in Cologne; Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Gottingen, Germany; the French National Space Agency in, Paris; and the Italian Space Agency in Rome. A division of Caltech, NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California managed the U.S. contribution of the Rosetta mission for NASA&#39;s Science Mission Directorate in Washington. JPL also built the MIRO and hosts its principal investigator, Mark Hofstadter. The Southwest Research Institute (San Antonio and Boulder, Colorado), developed the Rosetta orbiter&#39;s IES and Alice instruments and hosts their principal investigators, James Burch (IES) and Joel Parker (Alice).</p>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">Saudi Airlines is selling tickets for the fourth consecutive day to help expatriate Bangladeshis return to their workplaces in the kingdom.</p>

<p>People who have already gotten their tokens are collecting tickets since morning.</p>

<p>Tickets will be given to those holding tokens 1,401-1,900 on Sunday while those from 1,901-2,300 will get theirs on Monday.</p>

<p>Saudi Airlines started issuing tickets for Bangladeshi expatriates on Thursday morning, a day after migrant workers demonstrated in Dhaka for return tickets to the kingdom.</p>

<p>They came home with return tickets but could not go back due to a shortage of Biman flights amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Migrant workers demonstrated in front of the Expatriates&rsquo; Welfare Ministry in Eskaton, demanding extension of visas and Iqamas and arrangement of return tickets to Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>On Wednesday evening, the foreign minister said Bangladeshi expatriates will be able to return to their workplaces as both Biman and Saudi airlines got permission to operate flights.</p>

<p>AK Abdul Momen said the Saudi government agreed to extend visas for those Bangladeshis who want to return to the kingdom but their visas expired.</p>

<p>He also said the Iqama of Bangladeshi workers will remain valid for 24 more days and there will be a further extension, if required.</p>

<p>The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the most popular destination for migrant workers from Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Last year, Bangladeshis sent back US$18.355 billion in remittance. Of the amount, $3.647 billion (19.87 percent) were sent back from Saudi Arabia.</p></description>

<p>Migrant workers demonstrated in front of the Expatriates&rsquo; Welfare Ministry in Eskaton, demanding extension of visas and Iqamas and arrangement of return tickets to Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>On Wednesday evening, the foreign minister said Bangladeshi expatriates will be able to return to their workplaces as both Biman and Saudi airlines got permission to operate flights.</p>

<p>AK Abdul Momen said the Saudi government agreed to extend visas for those Bangladeshis who want to return to the kingdom but their visas expired.</p>

<p>He also said the Iqama of Bangladeshi workers will remain valid for 24 more days and there will be a further extension, if required.</p>

<p>The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the most popular destination for migrant workers from Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Last year, Bangladeshis sent back US$18.355 billion in remittance. Of the amount, $3.647 billion (19.87 percent) were sent back from Saudi Arabia.</p>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">The remains of 117 Chinese soldiers killed in the 1950-53 Korean War were returned to China on Sunday from the Republic of Korea (ROK).</p>

<p>Escorted by two Chinese fighter jets, an air force plane carrying the remains and belongings of the fallen soldiers landed at the Taoxian international airport in Shenyang, capital of northeast China&#39;s Liaoning Province, at 11:18 a.m.</p>

<p>It is the seventh such repatriation following a handover agreement signed by the two countries.</p>

<p>The remains were casketed in the ROK on Saturday at a ceremony held at a provisional morgue of the 17th army division of the ROK in Incheon, west of the capital Seoul.</p>

<p>Personal seals of three martyrs -- Ma Shixian, Lin Shuishi and Ding Zuxi -- were found in the belongings, providing clues for confirming the identities of the heroes and finding their relatives.</p>

<p>The remains will be buried in a martyrs&#39; cemetery in Shenyang, with a burial ceremony due to be held Monday. The remains of 599 soldiers sent back from the ROK have been buried there between 2014 and 2019.</p>

<p>The Chinese People&#39;s Volunteers fought with the army of the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea in the Korean War against the ROK army and U.S.-led UN forces between 1950 and 1953. Enditem</p></description>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina stressed the need for better cooperation with the neighboring countries for the development of the people of the region.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our foreign policy is &lsquo;friendship to all and malice to none&rsquo;. We always think that better cooperation with the neighboring countries is firstly needed for the development of the people of the region,&rdquo; she said when outgoing Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh, Riva Ganguly Das called on her at her official Ganabhaban residence on Sunday&nbsp;morning.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina also said the neighboring countries can use Bangladesh&rsquo;s Chattogram, Sylhet, and Syedpur Airports for their convenience.</p>

<p>After the meeting, PM&rsquo;s Press Secretary Ihsanul Karim briefed reporters.</p>

<p>He said the prime minister and the high commissioner discussed issues related to bilateral interests.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 situation and the protracted Rohingya crisis also came up for discussion, the press secretary informed.</p>

<p>In this connection, Riva Ganguly said the two countries are working together to combat the deadly COVID-19.</p>

<p>She appreciated the steps Bangladesh has taken under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to contain the pandemic.</p>

<p>The Indian envoy also lauded Bangladesh&rsquo;s economic development under the leadership of the prime minister amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said the people of all classes and professions are working together during this crisis.</p>

<p>The prime minister mentioned that massive programs had been taken on the occasion of the &lsquo;Mujib Borsho&rsquo;. &ldquo;But we could not celebrate many programs due to coronavirus outbreak,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>She said alongside the government&rsquo;s regular tree plantation campaign, her party has taken a special program to plant one core trees across the country during the Mujib Borsho.</p>

<p>The high commissioner handed over a letter of Indian Premier Narendra Modi to Sheikh Hasina in which he (Modi) greeted the Bangladesh premier on the occasion of her 74th birthday.</p>

<p>She said the people of India and its all political parties extended overwhelming support to Bangladesh&rsquo;s Liberation War, and in the same way they supported the historic land boundary agreement with Bangladesh.</p>

<p>The Indian envoy informed the prime minister that the foreign ministers of the two countries are likely to hold talks virtually on Tuesday.</p>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">Clashes have begun between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, with at least one Azerbaijani helicopter shot down, News BBC.</p>

<p>Armenia said Azerbaijan had launched an air and artillery attack. It later declared martial law and total military mobilization.</p>

<p>Azerbaijan said it was responding to shelling along the whole front. Both sides have reported civilian deaths.</p>

<p>The long-running conflict has flared up again in recent months.</p>

<p>Russia&#39;s Foreign Ministry called for an immediate ceasefire and talks to stabilize the situation.</p>

<p>Both Armenia and Azerbaijan were part of the Soviet Union before its collapse in 1991.</p>

<p>For four decades they have been stuck in an unresolved conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but controlled by ethnic Armenians.</p>

<p>Border fighting in July killed at least 16 people, prompting the largest popular demonstration for years in the Azerbaijani capital Baku calling for full mobilization and the recapture of the region.</p>

<p>The Armenian Defence Ministry said an attack on civilian settlements, including the regional capital Stepanakert, began at 08:10 local time (04:10 GMT).</p>

<p>It said it had shot down two helicopters and three drones, and destroyed three tanks.</p>

<p>&quot;Our response will be proportionate, and the military-political leadership of Azerbaijan bears full responsibility for the situation,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>

<p>Officials said a woman and child had been killed, and further reports of casualties were being verified.</p>

<p>Armenia&#39;s government declared martial law and total military mobilization, shortly after a similar announcement by the authorities in the separatist region.</p>

<p>&quot;Get ready to defend our sacred homeland,&quot; Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said in a statement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Azerbaijan announced a &quot;counter-offensive operation of our troops along the entire front to suppress the combat activity of the armed forces of Armenia and ensure the safety of the civilian population&quot;.</p>

<p>Intensive shelling of several villages had led to civilians being killed or wounded, and severe damage to infrastructure, its Defence Ministry said.</p>

<p>It added that one helicopter had been lost but the crew had survived, and 12 Armenian air defence systems had been destroyed. It denied other losses reported by Armenia.</p>

<p>Tensions last flared into conflict in 2016, with the countries clashing over the disputed territory for four days.</p>

<p>The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has long been trying to mediate a settlement of the conflict, with diplomats from France, Russia and the US - making up the OSCE Minsk Group - trying to build on a ceasefire.</p></description>

		<title>Tk 10,200cr swindle by PK Halder, associates so far: Probe finds</title>
		<link>tk-10200cr-swindle-by-pk-halder-associates-so-far-probe-finds/21</link>
		<guid>e1aa32f750fe77fe52bc91f7eb59de6b</guid>
		<pubDate>Sun, 27 Sep 2020 21:17:34 +06:00</pubDate>
		<author>Staff Correspondent</author>
		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">The amount of money embezzled by Prashanta Kumar Halder alias PK Halder and his associates from four non-banking financial institutions (NBFIs) might leave you baffled.</p>

<p>It&#39;s neither Tk 2,500 crore nor Tk 3,500 crore --- figures which have been reported by the media lately.</p>

<p>Investigators now say they have so far learnt that the amount is at least Tk 10,200 crore or $120.36 crore.</p>

<p>With the money, at least seven structures like the capital&#39;s Mouchak-Moghbazar Flyover could have been built in the country.</p>

<p>Using 30 organisations, owned by Halder and his associates, Halder misappropriated loans of Tk 10,200 crore from the NBFIs and laundered the money to Canada, Singapore and India, according to the investigators.</p>

<p>They said Halder, who is now in Canada, embezzled Tk 2,500 crore from International Leasing and Financial Services Limited (ILFSL), Tk 2,200 crore from FAS Finance, Tk 3,000 crore from Peoples&#39; Leasing and Tk 2,500 crore from Reliance Finance.</p>

<p>The allegation of embezzlement against Halder surfaced after the Anti-Corruption Commission launched an enquiry into the wealth of illegal casino owners last year.</p>

<p>On January 8 this year, the ACC filed a case against him for amassing property worth around Tk 274.91 crore from unknown sources.</p>

<p>The ACC and the Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit (BFIU) of BB are now looking into the matter.</p>

<p>The two agencies are trying to unearth how Halder and his men got the money out of the NBFIs.</p>

<p>Here are some snippets of information learnt from those linked to the investigation.</p>

<p>P&amp;L International Ltd, owned by Halder, maintains an account with a bank. Investigators claimed to have traced suspicious transaction of over Tk 708 crore through that account.</p>

<p>In order to hoodwink any future investigation, the suspected fraudster used to move his money among multiple financial institutions and accounts.</p>

<p>PK Halder was a deputy managing director of Industrial and Infrastructure Development Finance Company Limited (IIDFC) in 2008. He joined Reliance Finance as its managing director the next year. He became the managing director of NRB Global Bank in July 2015.</p>

<p>Pointing to a Tk 60 crore loan to MTB Marine Ltd sanctioned at a board meeting of ILFSL on January 30, 2017, ACC sources said the money never reached the company&#39;s bank account.</p>

<p>It was rather transferred to accounts of different organizations and different people.</p>

<p>About Tk 5.5 crore was transferred to the accounts of Padma Weaving Ltd, Tk 14 crore to Paramount Agro, Tk 3 crore to Ookayama Limited, Tk 1.08 crore to Tasmiha Book Binding, Tk 11 crore to JK Trade International and Tk 4 crore to four personal accounts.</p>

<p>The transfer took place between February and July 2017, said ACC sources.</p>

<p>Swapan Kumar Mistri was ILFSL&#39;s director while his wife was MTB Marine&#39;s chairman. Swapan was also a director of HAL International, owned by PK Halder.</p>

<p>Swapan&#39;s brother Uttam Kumar Mistri is the managing director of Kolasin Limited. Uttam&#39;s wife Atoshi Mridha was the chairman of Kolasin, situated in Free School Street in the capital.</p>

<p>Together, they applied for a loan of Tk 79.7 crore as working capital for Kolasin on August 29, 2016. The loan was approved on September 5 the same year.</p>

<p>&quot;It was an organization only on papers. Showing loan against Kolasin, the money was transferred to the accounts of different people and organisations,&quot; one ACC official said, wishing not to be named.</p>

<p>Of the loan money, on December 27, 2016, about Tk 25.97 crore was issued to Nature Enterprise. The money was later transferred to Reliance Finance.</p>

<p>Nature Enterprise was one of the shareholders of ILFSL and two of its directors were board members of the NBFI, ACC sources said.</p>

<p>The money was used to adjust a loan for Nature Enterprise with Reliance Finance.</p>

<p>About Tk 17.4 crore was transferred to EBL Securities Ltd, Tk 6 crore to International Leasing Securities and International Leasing Capital, Tk 6.25 crore to Paramount Spinning Ltd and Paramount Holding Ltd, Tk 4 crore was transferred to JK Trader&#39;s account while about Tk 4.9 crore landed in two personal accounts, said investigation sources.</p>

<p>About Tk 50 lakh was transferred to Hal International&#39;s account at Bank Asia&#39;s Dhanmondi branch.</p>

<p>The ILFSL sanctioned loans of about Tk 83.34 crore to Moon Enterprise, owned by Shangkha Bepari, believed to be an associate of Halder.</p>

<p>Of the money, Tk 21.24 crore was used to adjust loan of Marco Traders with Reliance Finance. Director of ILFSL Nowsher-ul Islam is owner of Marco Traders.</p>

<p>Again, on March 29, 2016, about Tk 3 crore was transferred to PK Halder&#39;s personal bank account.</p>

<p>Hal International received Tk 6 crore while Tk 12.6 crore was transferred to Paramount Spinning Ltd&#39;s accounts with Mercantile and Meghna and NRB Global Bank Ltd.</p>

<p>Sources said between 2015 and 2019, PK Halder&#39;s cousin Amitav Adhikari was the director of People&#39;s Leasing and Financial Services and former colleague Uzzal Kumar Nandi was its chairman.</p>

<p>Amitav is also the managing director of Anan Chemicals. Its current director and chairman is Uzzal and his wife Anita Kar is its director. Although they were at the helm of the organization, PK Halder was its actual owner, ACC officials said.</p>

<p>ACC sources said that using &quot;name-only&quot; organizations, PK Halder took money from ILFSL and became chairman and director of Peoples&#39; Leasing. Later, he took money from Peoples&#39; Leasing and dragged it down.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, PK Halder said he would come back to the country to return the money and settle the transactions and liabilities with the company if he gets &quot;proper security for his life&quot;.</p>

<p>He has recently sent a letter to the ILFSL to this end.</p>

<p>The board of directors of ILFSL discussed the letter at its meeting. The organization placed it along with an application before the High Court on September 7 through its lawyer Mahfuzur Rahman Milon for necessary orders.</p>

<p>After examining the letter and application, the HC yesterday directed the ILFSL to inform it when PK Halder would return to Bangladesh for settling his transactions and liabilities with the company.</p>

<p>The court said it would pass necessary orders for ensuring legal security of Halder&#39;s life on his return to the country and if he specifies his time of visit.</p>

<p>PK Halder will remain in the custody of the court after he returns, the HC bench said.</p>

<p>Board of directors, chairman and managing director of ILFS were also responsible for the scam, found an ACC enquiry.</p>

<p>In another development, Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit (BFIU) has recently frozen accounts of 83 people and organizations with different banks over suspicious transactions.</p></description>

				<h2 style="text-align:justify">The amount of money embezzled by Prashanta Kumar Halder alias PK Halder and his associates from four non-banking financial institutions (NBFIs) might leave you baffled.</p>

<p>It&#39;s neither Tk 2,500 crore nor Tk 3,500 crore --- figures which have been reported by the media lately.</p>

<p>Investigators now say they have so far learnt that the amount is at least Tk 10,200 crore or $120.36 crore.</p>

<p>With the money, at least seven structures like the capital&#39;s Mouchak-Moghbazar Flyover could have been built in the country.</p>

<p>Using 30 organisations, owned by Halder and his associates, Halder misappropriated loans of Tk 10,200 crore from the NBFIs and laundered the money to Canada, Singapore and India, according to the investigators.</p>

<p>They said Halder, who is now in Canada, embezzled Tk 2,500 crore from International Leasing and Financial Services Limited (ILFSL), Tk 2,200 crore from FAS Finance, Tk 3,000 crore from Peoples&#39; Leasing and Tk 2,500 crore from Reliance Finance.</p>

<p>The allegation of embezzlement against Halder surfaced after the Anti-Corruption Commission launched an enquiry into the wealth of illegal casino owners last year.</p>

<p>On January 8 this year, the ACC filed a case against him for amassing property worth around Tk 274.91 crore from unknown sources.</p>

<p>The ACC and the Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit (BFIU) of BB are now looking into the matter.</p>

<p>The two agencies are trying to unearth how Halder and his men got the money out of the NBFIs.</p>

<p>Here are some snippets of information learnt from those linked to the investigation.</p>

<p>P&amp;L International Ltd, owned by Halder, maintains an account with a bank. Investigators claimed to have traced suspicious transaction of over Tk 708 crore through that account.</p>

<p>In order to hoodwink any future investigation, the suspected fraudster used to move his money among multiple financial institutions and accounts.</p>

<p>PK Halder was a deputy managing director of Industrial and Infrastructure Development Finance Company Limited (IIDFC) in 2008. He joined Reliance Finance as its managing director the next year. He became the managing director of NRB Global Bank in July 2015.</p>

<p>Pointing to a Tk 60 crore loan to MTB Marine Ltd sanctioned at a board meeting of ILFSL on January 30, 2017, ACC sources said the money never reached the company&#39;s bank account.</p>

<p>It was rather transferred to accounts of different organizations and different people.</p>

<p>About Tk 5.5 crore was transferred to the accounts of Padma Weaving Ltd, Tk 14 crore to Paramount Agro, Tk 3 crore to Ookayama Limited, Tk 1.08 crore to Tasmiha Book Binding, Tk 11 crore to JK Trade International and Tk 4 crore to four personal accounts.</p>

<p>The transfer took place between February and July 2017, said ACC sources.</p>

<p>Swapan Kumar Mistri was ILFSL&#39;s director while his wife was MTB Marine&#39;s chairman. Swapan was also a director of HAL International, owned by PK Halder.</p>

<p>Swapan&#39;s brother Uttam Kumar Mistri is the managing director of Kolasin Limited. Uttam&#39;s wife Atoshi Mridha was the chairman of Kolasin, situated in Free School Street in the capital.</p>

<p>Together, they applied for a loan of Tk 79.7 crore as working capital for Kolasin on August 29, 2016. The loan was approved on September 5 the same year.</p>

<p>&quot;It was an organization only on papers. Showing loan against Kolasin, the money was transferred to the accounts of different people and organisations,&quot; one ACC official said, wishing not to be named.</p>

<p>Of the loan money, on December 27, 2016, about Tk 25.97 crore was issued to Nature Enterprise. The money was later transferred to Reliance Finance.</p>

<p>Nature Enterprise was one of the shareholders of ILFSL and two of its directors were board members of the NBFI, ACC sources said.</p>

<p>The money was used to adjust a loan for Nature Enterprise with Reliance Finance.</p>

<p>About Tk 17.4 crore was transferred to EBL Securities Ltd, Tk 6 crore to International Leasing Securities and International Leasing Capital, Tk 6.25 crore to Paramount Spinning Ltd and Paramount Holding Ltd, Tk 4 crore was transferred to JK Trader&#39;s account while about Tk 4.9 crore landed in two personal accounts, said investigation sources.</p>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">Water levels in most of the rivers and tributaries in the Ganges basin recorded a rising trend for the third consecutive day today because of the onrushing of floodwater from the upstream hilly catchment areas.</p>

<p>Of the 30 river points, monitored in the Ganges basin today, water levels increased at 24 points, while receded at five points and remained stable at another point, according to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC).</p>

<p>However, the rivers were still flowing below the danger level at 26 points, while above the danger level at four other points today.</p>

<p>Of the 16 river points both in Ganges and Brahmaputra Basins, being monitored in many districts under Rajshahi division regularly, water levels increased at 13 points, while declined at three other points.</p>

<p>The rivers were flowing below the danger level in 12 points, while above the danger mark at another four points this morning.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the local administration has been continuously distributing relief materials in the worst-affected areas since the flood began.</p>

<p>More than 2.19 lakh families consisting of around 9.86 lakh people in different districts of the division affected badly by the flood have, so far, been got relief materials to overcome their livelihood related hardships.</p>

<p>Moinul Islam, additional commissioner of Rajshahi division, said distribution of the allocated relief materials among the affected families in the division is in final stage.</p>

<p>Apart from this, 2,260.9 tonnes of rice, Taka 31.10 lakh, 2,220 packets of dry food, Taka three lakh for baby food and Taka five lakh for animal feed remain in stock for distribution.</p>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">The government has procured more than 1.72 lakh tons of boro rice during the recently closed procurement drive contributing a lot towards ensuring food security amidst the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic situation.</p>

<p>As part of the nationwide boro rice procurement drive that closed on September 15 last, the government has procured the food grain from all eight districts in Rajshahi division despite the adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>In addition to the rice procurement, the government has also purchased 40,665 tons of boro paddy from the same areas at the same times.</p>

<p>Raihanul Kabir, Regional Controller of Food, said they have procured around 1.61 lakh tons of boiled rice and 11,348 tons of non-boiled sunned (Atap) rice till the stipulated day.</p>

<p>He said procurement drive of the newly harvested rice had gone on in full swing everywhere in the division that created a high hope of ensuring food security amid the present adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Raihanul Kabir said the government had set a target of procuring 2,39,067 tons of boiled rice, 23,664 tons of non-boiled sunned rice and 1,42,495 tons of paddy in the division during the current season. Boiled rice has been procured at the rate of Taka 36 per kilogram while non-boiled rice at Taka 35 per kilogram.</p>

<p>Contracts had been signed with 5,370 millers for collecting 2,35,199.76 tons of boiled rice, while 160 other millers for supplying 21,099.17 tons of non-boiled rice. Besides, 11,352 tons of wheat were procured.</p>

<p>Currently, farmers are now very much pleased with the present lucrative market price for the latest harvested Boro and Aush paddy in the entire region including its vast Barind tract. The prevalent selling price rate was over expectation to the farmers.</p>

<p>After getting the profitable price of their paddy the farmers are seen bustling with harvesting of aush besides farming of transplanted aman paddy with more attention.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, despite the adverse impacts of both the Covid-19 pandemic and the flood, Aman paddy transplantation has exceeded the target in Rajshahi division creating scopes of producing additional yield of the food grain.</p>

<p>The Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) has set the target of producing around 22.19 lakh tonnes of Aman rice from around 7.66 lakh hectares of land in all eight districts under the division during the current season.</p>

<p>But, amazingly, the enthusiastic farmers have brought more than 7.77 lakh hectares of land exceeding the target by 11,540 hectares braving the current pandemic and disastrous situations.</p>

<p>According to the farmers and the DAE sources, the target has been exceeded as the farmers are seen humming towards more paddy farming side by side with suitable climate conditions with frequent rainfall.</p>

<p>Apart from this, harvesting of Aush paddy is now the closing stage and the farmers are very much happy after getting the over-expected paddy yield alongside availing the scopes of spot selling of the newly harvested paddy.</p>

<p>The DAE has set a target of producing around 7.5 lakh tons of Aush rice from 2.52 lakh hectares of land in the division. But, the farmers cultivated the paddy on around 2.54 lakh hectares of land.</p>

<p>Sudhendra Nath Roy, Additional Director of DAE, Rajshahi, said the government has adopted diversified steps including incentives and technological support to promote the aush rice farming.</p>

<p>Government incentives; technological assistance, high yielding seeds, suitable climatic condition, frequent rainfall and satisfactory yield and market price of the newly harvested Boro paddy and rice are being adjudged as the major factors of exceeding the farming target.</p></description>

		<author>Staff Correspondent</author>
		<description><p>The&nbsp;court set October 12 for delivering its verdict in an arms case filed against Shamima Nur Papia and her husband Mofizur Rahman Suman.</p>

<p>Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge KM Imrul Kayes fixed the date after presenting arguments of the prosecution and the defence on Sunday.</p>

Seven passports, 2,12,270, fake notes worth Tk 25,600, $11,481, 420 Sri Lankan rupees, 301 Indian rupees and two debit cards were also recovered from their possession.</p>

<p>Later, the elite force members raided Papia&#39;s two luxurious flats in the capital&rsquo;s Indira Road area and recovered a foreign-made pistol, two magazines, 20 bullets, five bottles of foreign liquor and Tk 58.41 lakh in cash, among other things.</p>

<p>One case was filed under the Arms Act with Sher-e-Bangla Nagar Police Station, one under the Special Powers Act and another under the Special Powers Act with the Airport Police Station.&nbsp;</p></description>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">A total of 108 surviving pilot whales have been released back into the sea after a mass stranding in Australia; news BBC according to the country&rsquo;s marine experts. They believe Macquarie Harbour on Tasmania&#39;s west coast is now clear of live whales.</p>

<p>But about 350 whales died in what is Australia&#39;s worst stranding on record.</p>

<p>Now attention has turned to disposal of the carcasses, with 15 buried at sea on Friday in a trial to test the success of that method.</p>

<p>A statement released by the Tasmanian government on Saturday confirmed that 108 long-finned pilot whales which had survived the stranding had been released outside the heads at Macquarie Harbour.</p>

<p>Marine Conservation Program wildlife biologist Dr Kris Carlyon called it a fantastic outcome after five days of hard work by the rescue team.</p>

<p>&quot;We only had one whale restrand overnight, which is a good result given 20 whales were released yesterday,&quot; Dr Carlyon said.</p>

<p>At least four whales had to be euthanized earlier in the week as they were too exhausted to be saved.</p>

<p>Efforts are now being made to remove the carcasses from the harbour. This would take a number of days and depend on wind, tide and other conditions, said the government statement.</p>

<p>Rescuers help a whale stranded in shallow surf</p>

<p>&quot;Yesterday, 15 whales were buried at sea in a trial to determine the success of this disposal method,&quot; Rob Buck, Incident Controller and Parks and Wildlife Service (PWS) manager, said.</p>

<p>&quot;Collection and disposal is being undertaken with the assistance of aquaculture companies whose equipment and expertise on the harbour is essential for a timely and effective outcome.&quot;</p>

<p>Local residents have been urged to stay away from the area while the removal is under way.</p>

<p>The pilot whales washed up on sand spits in the sea around Macquarie Heads on Monday.</p>

<p>The first rescuers counted about 270 whales, but a helicopter on Tuesday spotted another 200 whales nearby. Officials said the second group was believed to be part of the same pod but might have washed in with the tide.</p>

<p>More than 80% of Australian whale strandings take place in Tasmania and experts say Macquarie Heads is a known hotspot.</p>

<p>The stranding was one of the largest ever recorded globally and eclipsed a previous national record of 320 whales beached in Western Australia in 1996.</p>

<p>It is not fully understood why the whales became stranded but pilot whales are known to be more prone to getting beached. They are not considered endangered, although exact population numbers are not known.</p>

<p>There are a range of theories for why beachings occur. Some experts say the animals can become disoriented after following fish they hunt to the shore.</p>

<p>Others believe that one individual can mistakenly lead whole groups to shore.</p>

<p>Researchers also believe that such groups are susceptible around beaches which gently slope across a wide area because the whales&#39; sonar pulses can fail to detect the shoreline in shallow waters.</p></description>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that nuclear war could not be won and that it must not be fought.</p>

<p>In his message on the International Day for the Abolition of Nuclear Weapons, the Secretary-General said, &ldquo;The use of nuclear weapons would affect all states, meaning that all states have a responsibility to ensure that such deadly armaments are never used again and are eliminated completely from national arsenals&rdquo;.</p>

It provides an opportunity to educate the public - and their leaders - about the real benefits of eliminating such weapons, and the social and economic costs of perpetuating them.</p></description>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">US President Donald Trump has nominated Amy Coney Barrett, a favorite of social conservatives, to be the new Supreme Court justice.</p>

<p>Speaking by her side at the White House Rose Garden, Mr Trump described her as a &quot;woman of unparalleled achievement&quot;.</p>

<p>If confirmed by senators, Judge Barrett will replace liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg who died recently, aged 87.</p>

<p>The nomination will spark a bitter confirmation fight in the Senate as November&#39;s presidential election looms.</p>

<p>Announcing Judge Barrett as his nominee on Saturday, President Trump described her as a &quot;stellar scholar and judge&quot; with &quot;unyielding loyalty to the constitution&quot;.</p>

		<description><h2 style="text-align:justify">We are going through an unimaginable bad time in human history due to COVID-19 epidemic. The pandemic is a stark reminder that our fates are interconnected and that no one is secured until everyone is secured; said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in her recorded speech to the 75th United Nations&rsquo; General Assembly for the very first time in the history of the United Nations, held digitally in the absence of the Heads of State and Government of the member countries at its headquarters in New York.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina today stressed timely and equitable access to prospective COVID-19 vaccines while addressing the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) amid a visible trend of &ldquo;vaccine nationalism&rdquo; when developed countries are prioritizing their access to prospective inoculates ahead of others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We hope that the COVID-19 vaccine will soon be available in the world. It is imperative to treat the vaccine as a &lsquo;global public good&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said in her UNGA statement this year through virtual media.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said &ldquo;the pandemic is a stark reminder that our fates are interconnected and that no one is secured until everyone is secured&rdquo; and therefore &ldquo;we need to ensure the timely availability of this vaccine to all countries at the same time&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The Bangladesh premier&rsquo;s pre-recorded speech came as United Nations stages its 75th UNGA session while the global COVID -19 pandemic forces the global forum to hold the annual assembly of world leaders through the virtual media in New York this year.</p>

<p>She delivered the speech in Bangla as she did in previous UNGA sessions as the premier, following Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman&rsquo;s footprint,</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina informed the UNGA about of higher infrastructural capacity of Bangladesh pharmaceutical industry and said if Bangladesh was provided with the technical know-how and patents, it could launch mass-scale productions of inoculates.</p>

<p>According to global health regulators, researchers are testing 42 vaccines in clinical trials on humans, and at least 93 preclinical vaccines are under active investigations in animals but developed countries were placing orders to vaccine makers for early availability of inoculates causing fears it could prolong the pandemic.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said the way the Second World War had prompted countries to join their hands to cooperate each other establishing the United Nations, the ongoing pandemic now warranted &ldquo;collective action&rdquo; in an identical manner under right leadership.</p>

<p>The Bangladesh premier&rsquo;s 17- minute speech simultaneously featured largely the Rohingya crisis while she also highlighted issues of climate change and migrant workers&rsquo; plight due to COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>She informed as well the UNGA Bangladesh&rsquo;s ongoing development campaign and efforts to attain the SDG goals and replicable success stories, her government&rsquo;s zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism and violent extremism and commitment to multilateralism and world peace.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina reiterated her call to the world community to play a more effective role in solving the protracted Rohingya crisis saying &ldquo;more than three years have elapsed (but) regrettably, not a single Rohingya could be repatriated&rdquo; as Bangladesh provided makeshift shelter to over 1.1 million forcibly displaced Myanmar people .</p>

<p>&ldquo;I request the international community to play a more effective role for a solution to the crisis,&rdquo; she said and suggested the solution to be explored in Myanmar as the crisis was created by Myanmar.</p>

<p>The Bangladesh premier described migrant workers as &ldquo;frontline contributors&rdquo; to the economies of their host and home countries alike and therefore they deserved a fair treatment in the countries where they were dedicating their services and an extra-empathy by the host nations and international community particularly during the current pandemic.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said the ongoing unprecedented crisis in humankind&rsquo;s history that forced as well the United Nations to stage for the first time its general assembly on digital platform debarring the heads of states physical presence at its New York headquarters.</p>

<p>She said the situation reflected how the pandemic affected the global economy and health systems while Bangladesh was no exception while the country recorded the record high 8.2 percent GDP growth in the last fiscal.</p>

<p>But, she said, as the pandemic broke out her government put in its efforts to strike a balance between &ldquo;life the livelihood&rdquo;, quickly identifying its impending rage on the financial sector and massively expanding the social safety nets coverage.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said under the initiative food and other assistance was readily arranged for people who are rendered jobless and these arrangements benefitted nearly 10 million families.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To ensure healthcare of the common people, we are providing 30 types of medicines free of cost through 18,000 community clinics and union health centres,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Moreover, the premier said, alongside the government assistance, she herself collected funds and distributed more than an amount of taka 2.5 billion among orphans, poor students, school teachers, artists, journalists and institutions like madrasas, mosques, temples, which otherwise were not included in government&rsquo;s assistance programs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a result, the impact of the pandemic among our people has been minimal,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>She said the quick situation analysis yielded 21 stimulus packages worth US$ 13.25 billion &ldquo;which is equivalent to 4.03% of our total GDP&rdquo; and added &ldquo;we have announced stimulus packages aiming to minimize the impact of the pandemic on our business and productivity.</p>

<p>The premier said these packages include sectors such as export-intensive industries, safety and security of the workers, working capital for small and medium enterprises, loan facilities for export growth, assistance to farmers and agriculture, loan for employment generation, interest relief for the affected business enterprises, refinancing schemes and insurance for the health workers.</p>

<p>The premier said soon after detection of first three COVID-19 cases in March in Bangladesh her government announced 31-point directive and launched vigorous awareness raising campaigns as well as distributed personal protective kits aiming to contain coronavirus spread.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These resulted in containment of seasonal diseases which are otherwise common in our country,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The premier said the pandemic prompted her government initially to lay highest emphasis on food production and ensure adequate supply of nutrition to people and subsequently special arrangements were made to keep running the essential industries.</p>

<p>She said services were ensured for proper marketing of agricultural products and industrial outputs in full compliance with health guidelines and as a result of these initiatives &ldquo;our health sector and economy are still comparatively at a better shape&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said despite the COVID-induced stagnation in global industrial outputs, Bangladesh&rsquo;s GDP registered a growth rate of 5.24 percent which, otherwise, however, was expected to be 7 percent in the next fiscal.</p>

<p>Noting that efforts to contain the pandemic and achieve Agenda 2030 have to go hand-in-hand, Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh&rsquo;s second voluntary national review (VNR) presented this year shows that the country is well on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every year, we allocate around Tk 39 billion for our freedom fighters. Our allowances for the elderly, widows, destitute women, disabled and other backward sections of the society are benefitting approximately 9.1 million families,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>The premier said the government has provided scholarships to four million students and also given cash incentives to five million people, including farmers, workers and laborers affected by the pandemic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re working hard to transform Bangladesh into a middle-income country by 2021, attain the SDGs by 2030, a developed country status by 2041 and a prosperous Delta by 2100,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>She continued: &ldquo;We cannot but emphasize more on the importance of leveraging science, technology and innovation for closing the digital divide and mobilizing resources and technology transfer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The premier said many of Bangladeshi migrant workers have lost their jobs during the pandemic, while many have been sent back home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have allocated US$ 361 million for the returnee migrant workers. It is critical to help them regain employment in the post-COVID job market &hellip; I urge the international community and migrant receiving countries to treat migrant workers fairly and with empathy during the crisis,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said it is also crucial that graduating LDCs and recently graduated ones are accorded scaled-up international support and incentive packages in the transition and post-transition phases to minimize the pandemic-triggered impediments.</p>

<p>She paid tribute to all frontline fighters including health workers and public servants who are working tirelessly to ensure safety of the COVID-19-affected countries and population. &ldquo;I also commend the United Nations Secretary-General for his bold leadership and multilateral efforts during this crisis,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The premier said the COVID-19 pandemic is worsening the pre-existing vulnerabilities of climate-vulnerable countries. &ldquo;In Bangladesh, we are dealing with the dual impact of recent floods and the cyclone Amphan even during the pandemic,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>As the current President of the CVF and the V-20 Group of Ministers of Finance, Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh would lead the forum to map out a sustainable and climate-resilient pathway out of the crisis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We also stand ready to contribute to securing a constructive and productive outcome in the Glasgow COP,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said the Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action has helped the international community come a long way to ensure gender equality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we are celebrating the 25th Anniversary of the Declaration, we need to strengthen our resolve and mutual cooperation to address all the critical areas of concern,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>About the women empowerment, the prime minister said Bangladesh has closed 72.6 percent of its overall gender gap. &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s contribution remains at the core of our national development. They are also at the forefront of pandemic response and recovery efforts,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh is implementing special programmes for the development of children. &ldquo;As the current President of the UNICEF Executive Board, we are leading efforts to address the existing disparity. At the same time, we remain vigilant to ensure that this health crisis does not turn into a children&rsquo;s crisis,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Pointing to the country&rsquo;s foreign policy, the premier said &ldquo;Friendship to all and malice to none&rdquo; is the fundamental principle of Bangladesh&rsquo;s foreign policy.</p>

<p>Inspired by this foreign policy dictum, she said, Bangladesh has been consistently contributing to international peace and security and the establishment of a Culture of Peace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;During the pandemic, we see the rise of hate speech, xenophobia, and intolerance. Embracing the spirit of a &lsquo;Culture of Peace&rsquo; can help address these worrying trends,&rdquo; Sheikh Hasina said.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said currently, Bangladesh is the largest troops and police-contributing country in the world to the peacekeeping missions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our peacekeepers are putting their lives on the line to secure and sustain peace in conflict-ravaged countries. International community must ensure their safety and security,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The prime minister called for due recognition of women&rsquo;s role in peace and security, saying: &ldquo;This year we are celebrating the 20th Anniversary of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As one of its original proponents, we call for due recognition of women&rsquo;s role in peace and security. We have already formulated a national action plan in this regard,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh&rsquo;s unflinching commitment to peace has resulted in the adoption of a zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism and violent extremism.</p>

<p>The premier said Bangladesh consistently and strongly supports the global quest for a nuclear weapons free world. &ldquo;To that end, we support the aspirations of developing countries to benefit from the peaceful use of nuclear technology,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our painful experience and the worst form of genocide and crimes against humanity that our nation had to endure during our struggle for independence motivated us to support the legitimate cause of the Palestinian people,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said the COVID-19 pandemic has indeed aggravated existing global challenges and it has also reinforced the indispensability of multilateralism.</p>

<p>The premier said on the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations, Bangladesh&rsquo;s commitment to multilateralism as embodied in the UN Charter remains unflinching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the national level, despite numerous challenges, we are committed to upholding the values of multilateralism and working towards building a &ldquo;Sonar Bangla&rdquo; free of poverty and exploitation based on democratic principles with full enjoyment of human rights, as envisioned by the Father of our Nation,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the birth centenary of our Father of the Nation, this is our pledge to our nation and to the world,&rdquo; Sheikh Hasina added.</p>

<p>At the outset of her speech, the premier congratulated Volkan Bozkir on his election as the President of the 75th UNGA.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said the UN General Assembly Hall evokes deep emotions in her. &ldquo;From this very hall in 1974, my father Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman delivered a speech for the first time in Bangla as the head of the government of a newly independent country,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The premier said she had the privilege of attending the General Assembly Sessions in-person for 16 times. &ldquo;I emphasized world peace and solidarity in all my speeches. As a head of government, this year I am delivering my 17th speech in the Assembly,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>She said Bangladesh was among the first rank of countries to endorse the UN Secretary-General&rsquo;s various initiatives, including his global ceasefire appeal.</p>

<p>Paying profound homage to Bangabandhu, the prime minister said Bangabandhu taught the Bangalee nation to stand firm in the world by ending exploitation, deprivation and oppression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Following his footsteps, we have been able to secure a respectable position for Bangladesh in the Comity of Nation,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina, the elder daughter of Bangabandhu, said: &ldquo;From this august Assembly he (Bangabandhu) declared &mdash; the noble ideals enshrined in the United Nations Charter are the very ideals for which millions of our people have made the supreme sacrifice. &hellip;.the Bangalee nation fully commits itself to the building of a world order, in which the aspiration of all men for peace and justice will be realized.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bangabandhu&rsquo;s statement was indeed a bold expression for multilateralism, the premier said, adding: &ldquo;The reflection that Bangabandhu made in 1974 continues to remain equally relevant even today, as we grapple with the current crisis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said this year is particularly significant for the Bangalee nation, as it is celebrating the birth centenary of the Father of our Nation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our reflection on his life, struggle, and sacrifice and celebration of his achievements, is a source of our encouragement for brighter future and give us the hope to cope with the challenge of COVID-19,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the birth centenary, we, on behalf of all deprived people and nations, pay rich tribute to Bangabandhu,&rdquo; she added.</p></description>

<p>The premier said these packages include sectors such as export-intensive industries, safety and security of the workers, working capital for small and medium enterprises, loan facilities for export growth, assistance to farmers and agriculture, loan for employment generation, interest relief for the affected business enterprises, refinancing schemes and insurance for the health workers.</p>

<p>The premier said soon after detection of first three COVID-19 cases in March in Bangladesh her government announced 31-point directive and launched vigorous awareness raising campaigns as well as distributed personal protective kits aiming to contain coronavirus spread.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These resulted in containment of seasonal diseases which are otherwise common in our country,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The premier said the pandemic prompted her government initially to lay highest emphasis on food production and ensure adequate supply of nutrition to people and subsequently special arrangements were made to keep running the essential industries.</p>

<p>She said services were ensured for proper marketing of agricultural products and industrial outputs in full compliance with health guidelines and as a result of these initiatives &ldquo;our health sector and economy are still comparatively at a better shape&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said despite the COVID-induced stagnation in global industrial outputs, Bangladesh&rsquo;s GDP registered a growth rate of 5.24 percent which, otherwise, however, was expected to be 7 percent in the next fiscal.</p>

<p>Noting that efforts to contain the pandemic and achieve Agenda 2030 have to go hand-in-hand, Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh&rsquo;s second voluntary national review (VNR) presented this year shows that the country is well on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every year, we allocate around Tk 39 billion for our freedom fighters. Our allowances for the elderly, widows, destitute women, disabled and other backward sections of the society are benefitting approximately 9.1 million families,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>The premier said the government has provided scholarships to four million students and also given cash incentives to five million people, including farmers, workers and laborers affected by the pandemic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re working hard to transform Bangladesh into a middle-income country by 2021, attain the SDGs by 2030, a developed country status by 2041 and a prosperous Delta by 2100,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>She continued: &ldquo;We cannot but emphasize more on the importance of leveraging science, technology and innovation for closing the digital divide and mobilizing resources and technology transfer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The premier said many of Bangladeshi migrant workers have lost their jobs during the pandemic, while many have been sent back home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have allocated US$ 361 million for the returnee migrant workers. It is critical to help them regain employment in the post-COVID job market &hellip; I urge the international community and migrant receiving countries to treat migrant workers fairly and with empathy during the crisis,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said it is also crucial that graduating LDCs and recently graduated ones are accorded scaled-up international support and incentive packages in the transition and post-transition phases to minimize the pandemic-triggered impediments.</p>

<p>She paid tribute to all frontline fighters including health workers and public servants who are working tirelessly to ensure safety of the COVID-19-affected countries and population. &ldquo;I also commend the United Nations Secretary-General for his bold leadership and multilateral efforts during this crisis,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The premier said the COVID-19 pandemic is worsening the pre-existing vulnerabilities of climate-vulnerable countries. &ldquo;In Bangladesh, we are dealing with the dual impact of recent floods and the cyclone Amphan even during the pandemic,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>As the current President of the CVF and the V-20 Group of Ministers of Finance, Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh would lead the forum to map out a sustainable and climate-resilient pathway out of the crisis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We also stand ready to contribute to securing a constructive and productive outcome in the Glasgow COP,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said the Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action has helped the international community come a long way to ensure gender equality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we are celebrating the 25th Anniversary of the Declaration, we need to strengthen our resolve and mutual cooperation to address all the critical areas of concern,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>About the women empowerment, the prime minister said Bangladesh has closed 72.6 percent of its overall gender gap. &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s contribution remains at the core of our national development. They are also at the forefront of pandemic response and recovery efforts,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh is implementing special programmes for the development of children. &ldquo;As the current President of the UNICEF Executive Board, we are leading efforts to address the existing disparity. At the same time, we remain vigilant to ensure that this health crisis does not turn into a children&rsquo;s crisis,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Pointing to the country&rsquo;s foreign policy, the premier said &ldquo;Friendship to all and malice to none&rdquo; is the fundamental principle of Bangladesh&rsquo;s foreign policy.</p>

<p>Inspired by this foreign policy dictum, she said, Bangladesh has been consistently contributing to international peace and security and the establishment of a Culture of Peace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;During the pandemic, we see the rise of hate speech, xenophobia, and intolerance. Embracing the spirit of a &lsquo;Culture of Peace&rsquo; can help address these worrying trends,&rdquo; Sheikh Hasina said.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said currently, Bangladesh is the largest troops and police-contributing country in the world to the peacekeeping missions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our peacekeepers are putting their lives on the line to secure and sustain peace in conflict-ravaged countries. International community must ensure their safety and security,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The prime minister called for due recognition of women&rsquo;s role in peace and security, saying: &ldquo;This year we are celebrating the 20th Anniversary of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As one of its original proponents, we call for due recognition of women&rsquo;s role in peace and security. We have already formulated a national action plan in this regard,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh&rsquo;s unflinching commitment to peace has resulted in the adoption of a zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism and violent extremism.</p>

<p>The premier said Bangladesh consistently and strongly supports the global quest for a nuclear weapons free world. &ldquo;To that end, we support the aspirations of developing countries to benefit from the peaceful use of nuclear technology,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our painful experience and the worst form of genocide and crimes against humanity that our nation had to endure during our struggle for independence motivated us to support the legitimate cause of the Palestinian people,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said the COVID-19 pandemic has indeed aggravated existing global challenges and it has also reinforced the indispensability of multilateralism.</p>

<p>The premier said on the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations, Bangladesh&rsquo;s commitment to multilateralism as embodied in the UN Charter remains unflinching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the national level, despite numerous challenges, we are committed to upholding the values of multilateralism and working towards building a &ldquo;Sonar Bangla&rdquo; free of poverty and exploitation based on democratic principles with full enjoyment of human rights, as envisioned by the Father of our Nation,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the birth centenary of our Father of the Nation, this is our pledge to our nation and to the world,&rdquo; Sheikh Hasina added.</p>

<p>At the outset of her speech, the premier congratulated Volkan Bozkir on his election as the President of the 75th UNGA.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said the UN General Assembly Hall evokes deep emotions in her. &ldquo;From this very hall in 1974, my father Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman delivered a speech for the first time in Bangla as the head of the government of a newly independent country,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The premier said she had the privilege of attending the General Assembly Sessions in-person for 16 times. &ldquo;I emphasized world peace and solidarity in all my speeches. As a head of government, this year I am delivering my 17th speech in the Assembly,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>She said Bangladesh was among the first rank of countries to endorse the UN Secretary-General&rsquo;s various initiatives, including his global ceasefire appeal.</p>

<p>Paying profound homage to Bangabandhu, the prime minister said Bangabandhu taught the Bangalee nation to stand firm in the world by ending exploitation, deprivation and oppression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Following his footsteps, we have been able to secure a respectable position for Bangladesh in the Comity of Nation,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina, the elder daughter of Bangabandhu, said: &ldquo;From this august Assembly he (Bangabandhu) declared &mdash; the noble ideals enshrined in the United Nations Charter are the very ideals for which millions of our people have made the supreme sacrifice. &hellip;.the Bangalee nation fully commits itself to the building of a world order, in which the aspiration of all men for peace and justice will be realized.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bangabandhu&rsquo;s statement was indeed a bold expression for multilateralism, the premier said, adding: &ldquo;The reflection that Bangabandhu made in 1974 continues to remain equally relevant even today, as we grapple with the current crisis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina said this year is particularly significant for the Bangalee nation, as it is celebrating the birth centenary of the Father of our Nation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our reflection on his life, struggle, and sacrifice and celebration of his achievements, is a source of our encouragement for brighter future and give us the hope to cope with the challenge of COVID-19,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the birth centenary, we, on behalf of all deprived people and nations, pay rich tribute to Bangabandhu,&rdquo; she added.</p>
